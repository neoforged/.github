# Maintainer Guidelines

This document aims to clarify policies and recommendations by which the Maintainer team operates. The goal is to help Maintainers understand what is expected of them and recommendations of how to reduce the chances of conflict within the Maintainer team. It also serves as a launch point for new maintainers to jump into how the team operates.

Each repository in the organization may have its own specific workflow. See documentation in the respective repository for details, or reach out to team members who have previously worked on those repositories. For our main repository, see the [docs folder](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/tree/1.21.x/docs).

## Recommendations

- It is recommended that Maintainers should ping `@Maintainers` on discord before merging important PRs. What is considered important enough to warrant a ping is left to maintainer discretion, but it is better to ping too often rather than not enough.

  - An important PR could be one that has a significant impact on many systems, changes the project ecosystem, or requires significant coordination with external projects. But ultimately, it is still left up to the maintainer discretion.
  
  - There is no hard enforcement of this guideline. It is a recommendation for good team communication and coordination. It allows the team to stay in the loop of what is going on and prevent conflicts between teammates. The examples given n the previous sub-bullet point helps to give a sense to what kind of PR is considered a "big-deal" but it is left a bit open-ended as PRs can take many forms. We will defer to the PR creator's to use their best judgement on whether a PR is something to keep the team informed about or not. The rate of "big-deal" PRs should be uncommon so ideally, this should not lead to an excess of maintainer pings.

  - If you are working on a seemingly high-impact PR and you are unsure if your should ping the team, then ping the team. If it is not actually high-impact, the PR still got more eyes to help review the PR to make sure it is good which is not a bad thing.
