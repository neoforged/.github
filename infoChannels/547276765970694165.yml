      Welcome to the official server of [The NeoForged Project](https://github.com/NeoForged)!
      Below you will find our general rules. We'd like if you'd first read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/neoforged/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which Moderators will refer to when doing their duties.

  - title: Rule 3. Please keep the channel topic in mind

      This includes pinging people that explicitly do not want to be pinged unnecessarily.

  - title: Moderation Policy
    description: |-
      We operate a 3 strikes policy. Rule violations (listed above) can trigger these actions.
      1. Strike one will result in an in channel warning stating which rule you violated
      2. Strike two will result in a timeout
      3. Strike three will result in a ban or read-only purgatory

      *Note that significant enough violations will lead to one or more of these steps being skipped.*

    Have a nice stay, and remember: if you feel like a member broke any of the rules please do not hesitate to contact moderators, either by pinging <@&1103212714219802654> or, by sending a message to <@1129791987680288798> if you feel more comfortable doing it that way.
    You can also report a message to moderators by right-clicking the message and then going to `Apps` > `Report`, which will open a ModMail thread with that message as context.

    P.S: here's an invite: <https://discord.neoforged.net>, and a backup one, just in case: <https://discord.gg/UvedJ9m>.
