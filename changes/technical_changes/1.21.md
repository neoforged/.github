4. Added NamespacedDirectoryLister which allows for mods to stitch specific textures they want from a specific namespaced folder to an atlas without accidentally pulling all other textures as well.

Now we have a solution for those mods to use instead.<br>[https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/pull/1488](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/pull/1488)
