# Minecraft 1.21.1-> 1.21.2 Mod Migration Primer

This is a high level, non-exhaustive overview on how to migrate your mod from 1.21.1 to 1.21.2. This does not look at any specific mod loader, just the changes to the vanilla classes.

## Pack Changes

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=1.21.2-pre5&tab=changelog).

## The Holder Set Transition

Many of the methods that used `TagKey`s or raw registry objects have been replaced with the direct `HolderSet` object. A `HolderSet` is essentially a list of registry object references that can be dynamically updated and managed as needed by the game. There are effectively two kinds of `HolderSet`s: direct and named. Named `HolderSet`s are the object representation of tags in game. It's called a named set as the `HolderSet` is referenced by the tag's name. Direct `HolderSet`s, on the other hand, are created by `HolderSet#direct`, which functions as an inlined list of values. These are useful when a separate object doesn't need to be defined to construct some value.

For a JSON example:
```json5
// HolderSet#direct with one element
{
    "holder_set": "minecraft:apple"
}

// HolderSet#direct with multiple elements
{
    "holder_set": [
        "minecraft:apple",
        "minecraft:stick"
    ]
}

// HolderSet reference (tags)
{
    "holder_set": "#minecraft:planks"
}
```

Generally, you should never be constructing holder sets incode except during provider generation. Each set type has a different method of construction.

First, to even deal with `Holder`s or `HolderSet`s, you will need access to the static registry instance via `Registry` or the datapack registry via `HolderGetter`. The `HolderGetter` is either obtained from a `BootstrapContext#lookup` during datapack registry generation or `HolderLookup$Provider#lookupOrThrow` either as part of generation or `MinecraftServer#registryAccess` during gameplay.

Once that is available, for direct `HolderSet`s, you will need to get the `Holder` form of a registry object. For static registries, this is done through `Registry#wrapAsHolder`. For datapack registries, this is done through `HolderGetter#getOrThrow`.

```java
// Direct holder set for Items
HolderSet<Item> items = HolderSet.direct(BuiltInRegistries.ITEM.wrapAsHolder(Items.APPLE));

// Direct holder set for configured features
// Assume we have access to the HolderGetter<ConfiguredFeature<?, ?>> registry
Holderset<ConfiguredFeature<?, ?>> features = HolderSet.direct(registry.getOrThrow(OreFeatures.ORE_IRON));
```

For named `HolderSet`s, the process is similar. For both static and dynamic registries, you call `HolderGetter#getOrThrow`.

```java
// Named holder set for Items
HolderSet<Item> items = BuiltInRegistries.ITEM.getOrThrow(ItemTags.PLANKS);

// Named holder set for biomes
// Assume we have access to the HolderGetter<Biome> registry
Holderset<Biome> biomes = registry.getOrThrow(BiomeTags.IS_OCEAN);
```

As these changes are permeated throughout the entire codebase, they will be listed in more relevant subsections.

## Gui Render Types

Gui rendering methods within `GuiGraphics` now take in a `Function<ResourceLocation, RenderType>` to determine how to render the image. Also, `blit` methods now require the size of the PNG to be specified.

```java
// For some GuiGraphics graphics
graphics.blit(
    // How to render the texture
    RenderType::guiTextured,
    // The previous texture parameters
    ...,
    // The size of the PNG to use
    256, 256);
```

This means methods that provided helpers towards setting the texture or other properties that could be specified within a shader have been removed.

- `com.mojang.blaze3d.pipeline.RenderTarget#blitToScreen(int, int, boolean)` -> `blitAndBlendToScreen`
- `net.minecraft.client.gui.GuiGraphics`
    - `drawManaged` is removed
    - `setColor` is removed - Now a parameter within the `blit` and `blitSprite` methods
    - `blit(int, int, int, int, int, TextureAtlasSprite, *)` is removed
    - `bufferSource` -> `drawSpecial`, not one-to-one as this takes in a consumer of the `MultiBufferSource` and ends the current batch instead of just returning the `MultiBufferSource`
- `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.PlayerFaceRenderer`
    - All `draw` methods except `draw(GuiGraphics, PlayerSkin, int, int, int)` takes in an additional `int` that defines the color
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.RenderType`
        - `guiTexturedOverlay` - Gets the render type for an image overlayed onto the game screen.
        - `guiOpaqueTexturedBackground` - Gets the render type for a GUI texture applied to the background of a menu.
        - `guiNauseaOverlay` - Gets the render type for the nausea overlay.
        - `guiTextured` - Gets the render type for an image within a GUI menu.
- `net.minecraft.client.resources.metadata.gui.GuiSpriteScaling$NineSlice` now takes in a boolean representing whether the center portion of the texture should be streched to fit the size

## Shader Rewrites

The internals of shaders have been rewritten quite a bit.

### Shaders Files

The main changes are the defined samplers and post shaders.

The `DiffuseSampler` and `DiffuseDepthSampler` have been given new names depending on the target to apply: `InSampler`, `MainSampler`, and `MainDepthSampler`. `InSampler` is used in everything but the `transparency` program shader.

```json5
// In some shader JSON
{
    "samplers": [
        { "name": "MainSampler" },
        // ...
    ]
}
```

Within post effect shaders, they have been changed completely. For a full breakdown of the changes, see `PostChainConfig`, but in general, all targets are now keys to objects, all pass inputs and filters are now lists of sampler inputs. As for how this looks:

```json5
// Old post effect shader JSON
// In assets/<namespace>/shaders/post
{
    "targets": [
        "swap"
    ],
    "passes": [
        {
            "name": "invert",
            "intarget": "minecraft:main",
            "outtarget": "swap",
            "use_linear_filter": true,
            "uniforms": [
                {
                    "name": "InverseAmount",
                    "values": [ 0.8 ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "blit",
            "intarget": "swap",
            "outtarget": "minecraft:main"
        }
    ]
}

// New post effect JSON
// In assets/<namespace>/post_effect
{
    "targets": {
        "swap": {} // Swap is now a target object (fullscreen unless otherwise specified)
    },
    "passes": [
        {
            // Name of the program to apply (previously 'name')
            // assets/minecraft/shaders/post/invert.json
            "program": "minecraft:post/invert",
            // Inputs is now a list
            "inputs": [
                {
                    // Targets the InSampler
                    // Sampler must be available in the program shader JSON
                    "sampler_name": "In",
                    // Reading from the main screen (previously 'intarget')
                    "target": "minecraft:main",
                    // Use GL_LINEAR (previously 'use_linear_filter')
                    "bilinear": true
                }
            ],
            // Writes to the swap target (previously 'outtarget')
            "output": "swap",
            "uniforms": [
                {
                    "name": "InverseAmount",
                    "values": [ 0.8 ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "program": "minecraft:post/blit",
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "sampler_name": "In",
                    "target": "swap"
                }
            ],
            "output": "minecraft:main"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Shader Programs

All shaders, regardless of where they are used (as part of a program or post effect), have a JSON within `assets/<namespace>/shaders`. This JSON defines everything the shader will use, as defined by `ShaderProgramConfig`. The main addition is the change to `ResourceLocation` relative references, and adding the `defines` header dynamically during load time.

```json5
// For some assets/my_mod/shaders/my_shader.json
{
    // Points to assets/my_mod/shaders/my_shader.vsh (previously 'my_shader', without id specification)
    "vertex": "my_mod:my_shader",
    // Points to assets/my_mod/shaders/my_shader.fsh (previously 'my_shader', without id specification)
    "fragment": "my_mod:my_shader",
    // Adds '#define' headers to the shaders
    "defines": {
        // #define <key> <value>
        "values": {
            "ALPHA_CUTOUT": "0.1"
        },
        // #define flag
        "flags": [
            "NO_OVERLAY"
        ]
    },
    // A list of sampler uniforms to use in the shader
    // There are 12 texture sampler uniforms Sampler0-Sampler11, though usually only Sampler0 is supplied
    // Additionally, there are dynamic '*Sampler' for post effect shaders which are bound to read the specified targets or 'minecraft:main'
    "samplers": [
        { "name": "Sampler0" }
    ],
    // A list of uniforms that can be accessed within the shader
    // A list of available uniforms can be found in CompiledShaderProgram#setUniforms
    "uniforms": [
        { "name": "ModelViewMat", "type": "matrix4x4", "count": 16, "values": [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ] },
        { "name": "ProjMat", "type": "matrix4x4", "count": 16, "values": [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ] },
        { "name": "ModelOffset", "type": "float", "count": 3, "values": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] },
        { "name": "ColorModulator", "type": "float", "count": 4, "values": [ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ] }
    ]
}
```

    // Out values should be set here

```

```glsl

#version 150

uniform sampler2D Sampler0;

// Uniforms provided by the JSON
uniform vec4 ColorModulator;

// Values to output to the framebuffer (the color of the pixel)
out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
    // Out values should be set here
}
```

On the code side, shaders are stored internally as either a `ShaderProgram` or a `CompiledShaderProgram`. `ShaderProgram` represents the identifier, while the `CompiledShaderProgram` represents the shader itself to run. Both are linked together through the `ShaderManager`.

Shader programs are compiled dynamically unless specified as a core shader. This is done by registering the `ShaderProgram` to `CoreShaders#PROGRAMS`.

```java
// List<ShaderProgram> PROGRAMS access
ShaderProgram MY_SHADER = new ShaderProgram(
    // Points to assets/my_mod/shaders/my_shader.json
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath('my_mod', 'my_shader'),
    // Passed in vertex format used by the shader
    DefaultVertexFormat.POSITION_COLOR,
    // Lists the '#define' values and flags
    // Value: '#define <key> <value>'
    // Flag: '#define <flag>'
    ShaderDefines.EMPTY
)
```

The shader programs are then set by calling `RenderSystem#setShader` with the `ShaderProgram` in question. In fact, all references to `GameRenderer#get*Shader` should be replaced with a `ShaderProgram` reference.

```java
// In some rendering method
RenderSystem.setShader(MY_SHADER);

// Creating a new ShaderStateShard for a RenderType
ShaderStateShard MY_SHARD = new ShaderStateShard(MY_SHADER);

## Entity Render States

Entity models and renderers have been more or less completely reworked due to the addition of `EntityRenderState`s. `EntityRenderState`s are essentially data object classes that only expose the computed information necessary to render the `Entity`. For example, a `Llama` does not need to know what is has in its inventory, just that it has a chest to render in the layer.

To start, you need to choose an `EntityRenderState` to use, or create one using a subclass if you need additional information passed to the renderer. The most common states to subclass is either `EntityRenderState` or `LivingEntityRenderState` for living entities. These fields should be mutable, as the state class is created only once for a renderer.

```java
// Assuming MyEntity extends LivingEntity
public class MyEntityRenderState extends LivingEntityRenderState {
    // An example of a field
    boolean hasExampleData;
}
```

From there, you create the `EntityModel` that will render your `Entity`. The `EntityModel` has a generic that takes in the `EntityRenderState` along with taking in the `ModelPart` root, and optionally the `RenderType` factory as part of its super. The are no methods to implement by default; however, if you need to setup any kind of model movement, you will need to overrride `setupAnim` which modifies the `ModelPart`'s mutable fields using the render state. If your model does not have any animation, then a `Model$Simple` implementation can be used instead. This does not need anything implemented.

```java
public class MyEntityModel extends EntityModel<MyEntityRenderState> {

    public MyEntityModel(ModelPart root) {
        super(root);
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public void setupAnim(MyEntityRenderState state) {
        // Calls resetPose and whatever other transformations done by superclasses
        super.setupAnim(state); 

        // Perform transformations to model parts here
    }
}
```

`EntityModel` also has three `final` methods from the `Model` subclass: `root`, which grabs the root `ModelPart`; `allParts`, which returns a list of all `ModelPart`s flattened; and `resetPose`, which returns the `ModelPart` to their default state.

`LayerDefinition`s, `MeshDefinition`s, `PartDefinition`s, and `CubeDeformation`s remain unchanged in their implementation and construction for the `ModelLayerLocation` -> `LayerDefinition` map in `LayerDefinitions`.

What about model transformations? For example, having a baby version of the entity, or where the model switches out altogether? In those cases, a separate layer definition is registered for each. For example, a Llama would have a model layer for the main Llama model, the baby model, the decor for both the adult and baby, and finally one for the spit. Since models are generally similar to one another with only a slight transformation, a new method was added to `LayerDefinition` to take in a `MeshTransformer`. `MeshTransformer`s are basically unary operators on the `MeshDefinition`. For baby models, a `BabyModelTransform` mesh transformer is provided, which can be applied via `LayerDefinition#apply`.

```java
public class MyEntityModel extends EntityModel<MyEntityRenderState> {
    public static final MeshTransformer BABY_TRANSFORMS = ...;

    public static LayerDefinition create() {
        // ...
    }
}

// Wherever the model layers are registered
ModelLayerLocation MY_ENTITY = layers.register("examplemod:my_entity");
ModelLayerLocation MY_ENTITY_BABY = layers.register("examplemod:my_entity_baby");

// Wherever the layer definitions are registered
defns.register(MY_ENTITY, MyEntityModel.create());
defns.register(MY_ENTITY_BABY, MyEntityModel.create().apply(MyEntityModel.BABY_TRANSFORMS));
```

But how does the model know what render state to use? That's where the `EntityRenderer` comes in. The `EntityRenderer` has two generics: the type of the `Entity`, and the type of the `EntityRenderState`. The `EntityRenderer` takes in a `Context` object, similar to before. Additionally, `getTextureLocation` needs to be implemented, though this time it takes in the render state instead of the entity. The new methods to implement/override are `createRenderState` and `extractRenderState`. `createRenderState` constructs the default render state object. `extractRenderState`, meanwhile, populates the render state for the current entity being rendered. `extractRenderState` will need to be overridden if you are not using an existing render state class.

Of course, there are also subclasses of the `EntityRenderer`. First, there is `LivingEntityRenderer`. This has an additional generic of the `EntityModel` being rendered, and takes that value in the constructor along with the shadow radius. This renderer also accepts `RenderLayer`s, which largely remain unchanged if you access the previous arguments through the render state. Then, there is the `MobRenderer`, which is what all entities extend. Finally, there is `AgeableMobRenderer`, which takes in two models - the adult and the baby - and decides which to render dependent on `LivingEntityRenderState#isBaby`. `AgeableMobRenderer` should be used with `BabyModelTransform` if the entity has a baby form. Otherwise, you will most likely use `MobRenderer` or `EntityRenderer`.

```java
public class MyEntityRenderer extends AgeableMobRenderer<MyEntity, MyEntityRenderState, MyEntityModel> {

    public MyEntityRenderer(EntityRendererProvider.Context ctx) {
        super(
            ctx,
            new MyEntityModel(ctx.bakeLayer(MY_ENTITY)), // Adult model
            new MyEntityModel(ctx.bakeLayer(MY_ENTITY_BABY)), // Baby model
            0.7f // Shadow radius
        );

        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public ResourceLocation getTextureLocation(MyEntityRenderState state) {
        // Return entity texture here
    }

    @Override
    public MyEntityRenderState createRenderState() {
        // Constructs the reusable state
        return new MyEntityRenderState();
    }

    @Override
    public void extractRenderState(MyEntity entity, MyEntityRenderState state, float partialTick) {
        // Sets the living entity and entity render state info
        super.extractRenderState(entity, state, partialTick);
        // Set our own variables
        state.hasExampleData = entity.hasExampleData();
    }
}

// Wherever the entity renderers are registered
renderers.register(MyEntityTypes.MY_ENTITY, MyEntityRenderer::new);

// For some UnbakedModel instance
public class MyUnbakedModel implements UnbakedModel {

    @Nullable
    protected ResourceLocation parentLocation;
    @Nullable
    protected UnbakedModel parent;
    private final List<ItemOverride> overrides;

    // ...

    @Override
    public void resolveDependencies(UnbakedModel.Resolver resolver) {
        // Get parent model for delegate resolution
        if (this.parentLocation != null) {
            this.parent = resolver.resolve(this.parentLocation);

## Equipments and Items, Models and All

Equipments and Items have had a major overhaul, most of which is spread throughout this documentation. This is some of the core change which, while they are important, do not deserve more than a cursory explanation due to their ease of change.

### Item Names and Models

The item name and model is now set directly within the properties using the `ITEM_NAME` and `ITEM_MODEL` data components, respectively. By default, this will use the same name and model location as previously, but these can be set via `Item$Properties#overrideDescription` and `#overrideModel`. `overrideDescription` takes in the translation key to use. There is also `useBlockDescriptionPrefix` and `useItemDescriptionPrefix` to change it to the default block and item translation keys, respectively. `overrideModel` takes in the relative `ResourceLocation` of the model JSON. For example, a value of `examplemod:example_item` will map to a `ModelResourceLocation` of `examplemod:example_item#inventory`. This is intended to link to the model JSON at `assets/examplemod/models/item/example_item.json`.

> There is a slight quirk to item models. The same key can also point to `assets/examplemod/models/example_item.json` if the modder decides to for a special model to load at that location under the `inventory` variant. So, it is recommended to avoid having model names with the same name in the root `models` and `models/item` subdirectory.

### Enchantable, Repairable Items

The enchantment value and repair item checks are being replaced with data components: `DataComponents#ENCHANTABLE` and `DataComponents#REPAIRABLE`, respectively. These can be set via the `Item$Properties#enchantable` and `#repairable`. As a result, `Item#getEnchantmentValue` and `isValidRepairItem` are removed.

### Elytras -> Gliders

Any item can act similarly to an elytra if they have the `DataComponents#GLIDER` value equipped. This essentially functions as a flag to indicate that the item can be used to glide. This works only if the item also has a `DataComponents#EQUIPPABLE` entry.

```java
new Item(
    new Item.Properties()
        .component(DataComponents.GLIDER, Unit.INSTANCE) // Sets as a glider
        .component(DataComponents.EQUIPPABLE, /*...*/) // Determines the slot to check whether it can be used
);
```

### Tools, via Tool Materials

`Tier`s within items have been replaced with `ToolMaterial`, which better handles the creation of tools and swords without having to implement each method manually. `ToolMaterial` takes in the same arguments as `Tier`, just as parameters to a single constructor rather than as implementable methods. From there, the `ToolMaterial` is passed to the `DiggerItem` subtypes, along with two floats representing the attack damage and attack speed. Interally, `ToolMaterial#apply*Properties` is called, which applies the `ToolMaterial` info to the `DataComponents#TOOL` and the attributes from the given `float`s.

```java
// Some tool material
public static final ToolMaterial WOOD = new ToolMaterial(
    BlockTags.INCORRECT_FOR_WOODEN_TOOL, // Tier#getIncorrectBlocksForDrops
    59, // Tier#getUses
    2.0F, // Tier#getSpeed
    0.0F, // Tier#getAttackDamageBonus
    15, // Tier#getEnchantmentValue
    ItemTags.WOODEN_TOOL_MATERIALS // Tier#getRepairIngredient
);

// When constructing the digger item subtype
new PickaxeItem(
    WOOD, // Tool material
    1.0f, // Attack damage
    -2.8f, // Attack speed
    new Item.Properties()
)
```

## Armor Materials, Equipment, and Model (Textures)

This is, by far, the largest change outside of consumables to items. `ArmorMaterial`s have effectively been made obsolete, as almost all of the logic is handled within data components, and attached to some resource pack JSON to load the associated textures. It is annoyingly complicated to understand at first glance, but is rather intuitive once you are familiar with the process.

### `ArmorMaterial`

`ArmorMaterial` is essentially a record that converts a list of properties to their proper location on the data components, NOT a registry object. This is done by passing in the item properties and an additional setting to either `#humanoidProperties` or `#animalProperties`. These settings should be familiar, as they remained unchanged from the previous version, the only difference is that they now specify a 'model id', which we will go into below. The armor material is used in conjunction with the `ArmorType`: an enum which defines the equipment slot the armor is placed into, the unit durability of each armor type, and the name (which is only used to construcct the attribute modifier id).

```java
ArmorMaterial exampleArmorMaterial = new ArmorMaterial(
    15, // The scalar durability to multiply the armor type against
    // A map of ArmorType -> half armor bars to apply to the entity ARMOR attribute
    // Should be set for all ArmorTypes
    Util.make(new EnumMap<>(ArmorType.class), map -> {
        map.put(ArmorType.BOOTS, 2);
        map.put(ArmorType.LEGGINGS, 5);
        map.put(ArmorType.CHESTPLATE, 6);
        map.put(ArmorType.HELMET, 2);
        map.put(ArmorType.BODY, 5);
    },
    25, // The enchantment value of the armor
    SoundEvents.ARMOR_EQUIP_IRON, // The holder wrapped sound event on what sound to make when the item is equipped
    0f, // The ARMOR_TOUGHNESS attribute value
    2f, // The KNOCKBACK_RESISTANCE attribute value,
    ItemTags.REPAIRS_DIAMOND_ARMOR, // An item tag representing the items that can repair this armor
    // The relative location of the EquipmentModel JSON
    // Points to assets/examplemod/models/equipment/example_armor_material.json
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_armor_material")
)
```

With the `ArmorMaterial`, this is either applied to the item properties by calling `humanoidProperties`, to apply the armor to a specific `ArmorType`; or `animalProperties` to apply the armor to the `BODY` and only allow specific entities to wear them.

Does this mean that `ArmorItem` and `AnimalArmorItem` are effectively pointless? For `AnimalArmorItem`, this can be argued. The only thing that `AnimalArmorItem` does is have a `$BodyType` parameter, which means that the armor can only be applied to a horse or a wolf, and specifies the item breaking sound. `ArmorItem`, on the other hand, only has one specific usecase: determining whether the item can be taken off or swapped. This implicity checks the currently wearing armor item to see whether it can't be taken off (via `PREVENT_ARMOR_CHANGE` enchantment) and calculating the properties on the replacing armor material so that any hotswaps will only improve their wearer's armor attribute values.

Let's go one level deeper.

### The Data Components

`ArmorMaterial` specifies eight data components to apply to item:

- `MAX_DAMAGE` - Set to the maximum durability of the item multiplied by the `ArmorType` unit durability
- `MAX_STACK_SIZE` - Set to 1
- `DAMAGE` - Set to 0
- `ATTRIBUTE_MODIFIERS` - Sets `ARMOR` and `ARMOR_TOUGHNESS` attributes, and `KNOCKBACK_RESISTANCE` when greater than 0
- `ENCHANTABLE` - Set to the enchantment value (not set when calling `animalProperties`)
- `REPAIRABLE` - Set to the `HolderSet` of the tag key representing the repairing ingredients
- `EQUIPPABLE` - Sets the slot, equip sound, model id, what entities can wear the item, and whether it is dispensible

Everything but `EQUIPPABLE` has already been explained above or has been around from a prior version, so this primer will only focus on `EQUIPPABLE` from now on.

### Equippable

`Equippable`, which used to be an interface, is now a data component that contains how an entity can equip this item and if the equipment should be rendered. Because of this, an item can only be equipped to a single slot. This can be done using the `Equippable` constructor or through the builder via `Equippable#builder`.

```java
new Item(
    new Item.Properties()
    .component(DataComponents.EQUIPPABLE, new Equippable(
        EquipmentSlot.HEAD, // The slot the item can be equipped to
        SoundEvents.ARMOR_EQUIP_IRON, // The sound to play when equipping the item
        // The relative location of the EquipmentModel JSON
        // Points to assets/examplemod/models/equipment/example_armor_material.json
        // When set to an empty optional, the item does not attempt to render as equipment
        Optional.of(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_armor_material")),
        // The relative location over the texture to overlay on the player screen when wearing
        // Points to assets/examplemod/textures/example_overlay.png
        // When set to an empty optional, does not render on the player screen
        Optional.of(ResourceLocation.withDefaultNamespace("examplemod", "example_overlay")),
        // A HolderSet of entities (direct or tag) that can equip this item
        // When set to an empty optional, any entity can equip this item
        Optional.of(HolderSet.direct(EntityType::builtInRegistryHolder, EntityType.ZOMBIE)),
        // Whether the item can be equipped when dispensed from a dispenser 
        true,
        // Whether the item can be swapped off the player during a quick equip
        false,
        // Whether the item should be damaged when attacked (for equipment typically)
        // Must also be a damageable item
        false
    ))
);
```

### Equipment Models?

So, as mentioned previously, `Equippable` items, and by extension the `ArmorMaterial` delegate, can specify a model id to determine how the equipment should render. However, what does this id link to? Well, it points to an `EquipmentModel` serialized as a JSON within `models/equipment` of the resource pack. This JSON defines the layers and textures of the equippable item to render. This does NOT specify the model, making the record a misnomer. It is better to think of this as the equipment textures applied to the passed in model.

`EquipmentModel` functions as a more feature generic version of the previous `ArmorMaterial$Layer`, which has been removed. Each `EquipmentModel` is functionally a map of `$LayerType`s to a list of `$Layer` to render.

A `$LayerType` is an enum representing the layer to render the equipment model as. While these are non-specific, they are implemented and read by specific entity renderer through the layer renderers. For example, `HUMANOID` is used by the `HumanoidArmorLayer` to render the head, chest, and feet; so any usage of `HUMANOID` will be rendered using that system. Another example is `WOLF_BODY` is used by `WolfArmorLayer` to render the body armor. As such, if using existing layer types (which is the only scenario unless your mod loader supports enum extensions), make sure that they are compatible with the existing renderers in place.

The `$Layer` list specifies the texture and dyeable options to use when rendering over the passed in model. The first parameter specifes the texture location, relative to `textures/entity/equipment`. The second parameter specifies an optional indicating whether the texture can be tinted (stored via the `ItemTags#DYEABLE` in conjunction with the `DYED_COLOR` data component). When specified, an optional color can be specified for when the item is not dyed. If empty, the armor will be invisible when not dyed. The final parameter indicates whether it should use the texture provided to the renderer instead, such as when rendering a custom elytra texture for the player.

```json5
// In assets/examplemod/models/equipment/example_armor_material.json
{
    // The layer map
    "layers": {
        // The serialized name of the EquipmentModel$LayerType to apply to
        "humanoid": [
            // A list of layers to render in the order provided in the list
            {
                // The relative texture of the layer
                // Points to assets/examplemod/textures/entity/equipment/example.png
                "texture": "examplemod:example",
                // When specified, allows the texture to be tinted the color in DYED_COLOR data component
                // Otherwise, cannot be tinted
                "dyeable": {
                    // An RGB value (always opaque color)
                    // 0x7683DE as decimal
                    // When not specified, set to 0 (meaning transparent or invisible)
                    "color_when_undyed": 7767006
                },
                // When true, uses the texture passed into the layer renderer instead
                "use_player_texture": true
            }
            // ...
        ]
        // ...
    }
}
```

```java
EquipmentModel.builder()
    .addLayers(EquipmentModel.LayerType.HUMANOID, new EquipmentModel.Layer(
        // The relative texture of the layer
        // Points to assets/examplemod/textures/entity/equipment/example.png
        ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example"),
        // When specified, allows the texture to be tinted the color in DYED_COLOR data component
        // Otherwise, cannot be tinted
        Optional.of(new EquipmentModel.Dyeable(
            // An RGB value (always opaque color)
            // When not specified, set to 0 (meaning transparent or invisible)
            Optional.of(0x7683DE)
        )),
        // When true, uses the texture passed into the layer renderer instead
        true
    )/*, ... */)
    .build();
```

The equipment model is then rendered by calling `EquipmentLayerRenderer#renderLayers` in the render function of an `EntityRenderer` or `RenderLayer`. `EquipementLayerRenderer` is passed in as part of the render context via `EntityRendererProvider$Context#getEquipmentRenderer`.

```java
// In some render method where EquipmentLayerRenderer equipmentLayerRenderer is a field
this.equipmentLayerRenderer.renderLayers(
    // The layer type to render
    EquipmentModel.LayerType.HUMANOID,
    // The model id representing the EquipmentModel JSON
    // This would be set in the `EQUIPPABLE` data component via `model`
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_armor_material"),
    // The model to apply the textures to
    // These are usually separate models from the entity model
    // and are separate ModelLayers linking to a LayerDefinition
    model,
    // The item stack representing the item being rendered as a model
    // This is only used to get the dyeable, foil, and armor trim information
    stack,
    // The stack used to render the model in the correct location
    poseStack,
    // The source of the buffers to get the vertex consumer of the render type
    bufferSource,
    // The packed light texture
    lighting,
    // An absolute path of the texture to render when use_player_texture is true for one of the layer if not null
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "textures/other_texture.png");
)
```

## Interaction Results

`InteracitonResult`s have been completely modified to encompass everything to one series of sealed implementations. The new implementation of `InteractionResult` combines both `InteractionResultHolder` and `ItemInteractionResult`, meaning that all uses have also been replcaed.

`InteractionResult` is now an interface with four implementations depending on the result type. First there is `$Pass`, which indicates that the interaction check should be passed to the next object in the call stack. `$Fail`, when used for items and blocks, prevents anything further in the call stack for executing. For entities, this is ignored. Finally, `$TryEmptyHandInteraction` tells the call stack to try to apply the click with no item in the hand, specifically for item-block interactions.

There is also `$Success`, which indicates that the interaction was successful and can be consumed. A success specifies two pieces of information: the `$SwingSource`, which indicates where the source of the swing originated from (`CLIENT` or `SERVER`) or `NONE` if not specified, and `$ItemContext` that handles whether there was an iteraction with the item in the hand, and what the item was transformed to.

None of the objects should be directly initialized. The implementations are handled through six constants on the `InteractionResult` interface:

- `SUCCESS` - A `$Success` object that swings the hand on the client.
- `SUCCESS_SERVER` - A `$Success` object that swings the hand on the server.
- `CONSUME` - A `$Success` object that does not swing the hand.
- `FAIL` - A `$Fail` object.
- `PASS` - A `$Pass` object.
- `TRY_WITH_EMPTY_HAND` - A `$TryEmptyHandInteraction` object.

```java
// For some method that returns an InteractionResult
return InteractionResult.PASS;
```

For success objects, if the item interaction should transform the held stack, then you call `$Success#heldItemTransformedTo`, or `$Success#withoutItem` if no item was used for the interaction.

```java
// For some method that returns an InteractionResult
return InteractionResult.SUCCESS.heldItemTransformedTo(new ItemStack(Items.APPLE));

// Or
return InteractionResult.SUCCESS.withoutItem();
```

- `net.minecraft.core.cauldron.CauldronInteraction`
    - `interact` now returns an `InteractionResult`
    - `fillBucket`, `emptyBucket` now returns an `InteractionResult`
- `net.minecraft.world`
    - `InteractionResultHolder`, `ItemInteractionResult` -> `InteractionResult`
- `net.minecraft.world.item`

    - `JukeboxPlayable#tryInsertIntoJukebox` now returns an `InteractionResult`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour#useItemOn`, `$BlockStateBase#useItemOn` now returns an `InteractionResult`

## Instruments, the Datapack Edition

`Instrument`s (not `NoteBlockInstrument`s) are now a datapack registry, meaning they must be defined in JSON or datagenned.

```json5
// In data/examplemod/instrument/example_instrument.json
{
    // The registry name of the sound event
    "sound_event": "minecraft:entity.arrow.hit",
    // How many seconds the instrument is used for
    "use_duration": 7.0,
    // The block range, where each block is 16 units
    "range": 256.0,
    // The description of the instrument
    "description": {
        "translate": "instrument.examplemod.example_instrument"
    },
}
```

```java
// For some RegistrySetBuilder builder
builder.add(Registries.INSTRUMENT, bootstrap -> {
    bootstrap.register(
        ResourceKey.create(Registries.INSTRUMENT, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_instrument")),
        new Instrument(
            BuiltInRegistries.SOUND_EVENT.wrapAsHolder(SoundEvents.ARROW_HIT),
            7f,
            256f,
            Component.translatable(Util.makeDescriptionId("instrument", ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_instrument")))
        )
    )
});
```

- `net.minecraft.world.item`
    - `Instrument` takes in a `float` for the use duration and a `Component` description.
    - `InstrumentItem#setRandom` is removed

## Trial Spawner Configurations, now in Datapack Form

`TrialSpawnConfig` are now a datapack registry, meaning they must be defined in JSON or datagenned.

```json5
// In data/examplemod/trial_spawner/example_config.json
{
    // The range the entities can spawn from the trial spawner block
    "spawn_range": 2,
    // The total number of mobs that can be spawned
    "total_mobs": 10.0,
    // The number of mobs that can be spawned at one time
    "simultaneous_mobs": 4.0,
    // The number of mobs that are added for each player in the trial
    "total_mobs_added_per_player": 3.0,
    // The number of mobs that can be spawned at one time that are added for each player in the trial
    "simultaneous_mobs_added_per_player": 2.0,
    // The ticks between each spawn
    "ticks_between_spawn": 100,
    // A weighted list of entities to select from when spawning
    "spawn_potentials": [
        {
            // The SpawnData
            "data": {
                // Entity to spawn
                "entity": {
                    "id": "minecraft:zombie"
                }
            },
            // Weighted value
            "weight": 1
        }
    ],
    // A weight list of loot tables to select from when the reward is given
    "loot_tables_to_eject": [
        {
            // The loot key
            "data": "minecraft:spawners/ominous/trial_chamber/key",
            // Weight value
            "weight": 1
        }
    ],
    // Returns the loot table to use when the the trial spawner is ominous
    "items_to_drop_when_ominous": "minecraft:shearing/bogged"
}
```

```java
// For some RegistrySetBuilder builder
builder.add(Registries.TRIAL_SPAWNER_CONFIG, bootstrap -> {
    var entityTag = new CompoundTag();
    entityTag.putString("id", BuiltInRegistries.ENTITY_TYPE.getKey(EntityType.ZOMBIE).toString());

    bootstrap.register(
        ResourceKey.create(Registries.INSTRUMENT, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_config")),
        TrialSpawnerConfig.builder()
            .spawnRange(2)
            .totalMobs(10.0)
            .simultaneousMobs(4.0)
            .totalMobsAddedPerPlayer(3.0)
            .simultaneousMobsAddedPerPlayer(2.0)
            .ticksBetweenSpawn(100)
            .spawnPotentialsDefinition(
                SimpleWeightedRandomList.single(new SpawnData(entityTag, Optional.empty(), Optional.empty()))
            )
            .lootTablesToEject(
                SimpleWeightedRandomList.single(BuiltInLootTables.SPAWNER_OMINOUS_TRIAL_CHAMBER_KEY)
            )
            .itemsToDropWhenOminous(
                BuiltInLootTables.BOGGED_SHEAR
            )
            .build()
    )
});
```

- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.trialspawner`
    - `TrialSpawner` now takes in a `Holder` of the `TrialSpawnerConfig`
        - `canSpawnInLevel` now takes in a `ServerLevel`
    - `TrialSpawnerConfig`
        - `CODEC` -> `DIRECT_CODEC`
        - `$Builder`, `builder` - A builder for a trial spawner configuration

## Recipe Providers, the 'not actually' of Data Providers

`RecipeProvider` is no longer a `DataProvider`. Instead, a `RecipeProvider` is constructed via a `RecipeProvider$Runner` by implementing `createRecipeProvider`. The name of the provider must also be specified.

```java
public class MyRecipeProvider extends RecipeProvider {

    // The parameters are stored in protected fields
    public MyRecipeProvider(HolderLookup.Provider registries, RecipeOutput output) {
        super(registries, output);
    }

    @Override
    protected void buildRecipes() {
        // Register recipes here
    }

    // The runner class, this should be added to the DataGenerator as a DataProvider
    public static class Runner extends RecipeProvider.Runner {

        public Runner(PackOutput output, CompletableFuture<HolderLookup.Provider> registries) {
            super(output, registries)
        }

        @Override
        protected RecipeProvider createRecipeProvider(HolderLookup.Provider registries, RecipeOutput output) {
            return new VanillaRecipeProvider(registries, output);
        }

        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "My Recipes";
        }
    }
}
```

- `net.minecraft.data.recipes`
    - `RecipeOutput#includeRootAdvancement` - Generates the root advancement for recipes.
    - `RecipeProvider` no longer extends `DataProvider`
        - The constructor takes in the lookup provider and a `RecipeOutput`, which are protected fields
        - `buildRecipes` does not take in any parameters
        - All generation methods do not take in a `RecipeOutput` and are instance methods
        - `$FamilyRecipeProvider` - Creates a recipe for a `BlockFamily` by passing in the `Block` the resulting block and the base block.
        - `$Runner` - A `DataProvider` that constructs the `RecipeProvider` via `createRecipeProvider`
    - `ShapedRecipeBuilder`, `ShapelessRecipeBuilder` now have private constructors and take in a holder getter for the items

## The Ingredient Shift

`Ingredient`s have be reimplemented to use a `HolderSet` as its base rather that it own internal `Ingredient$Value`. This most changes the call to `Ingredient#of` as you either need to supply it with `Item` objects or the `HolderSet` representing the tag. For more information on how to do this, see the [holder set section](#the-holder-set-transition).

- `net.minecraft.world.item.crafting.Ingredient`
    - `EMPTY` -> `Ingredient#of`, though the default usecases do not allow empty ingredients
    - `CODEC` is removed
    - `CODEC_NONEMPTY` -> `CODEC`
    - `testOptionalIngredient` - Tests whether the stack is within the ingredient if present, or default to an empty check if not.
    - `getItems` -> `items`
    - `getStackingIds` is removed
    - `of(ItemStack...)`, `of(Stream<ItemStack>)` is removed
    - `of(TagKey)` -> `of(HolderSet)`, need to resolve tag key

## BlockEntityTypes Privatized!

`BlockEntityType`s have been completely privatized and the builder being removed! This means that if a mod loader or mod does not provide some access widening to the constructor, you will not be able to create new block entities. The only other change is that the `Type` for data fixers was removed, meaning that all that needs to be supplied is the client constructor and the set of valid blocks the block entity can be on.

```java
// If the BlockEntityType constructor is made public
// MyBlockEntity(BlockPos, BlockState) constructor
BlockEntityType<MyBlockEntity> type = new BlockEntityType(MyBlockEntity::new, MyBlocks.EXAMPLE_BLOCK);
```

## Consumables

Consuming an item has been further expanded upon, with most being transitioned into separate data component entries.

### The `Consumable` Data Component

The `Consumable` data component defines how an item is used when an item is finished being used. This effectively functions as `FoodProperties` used to previously, except all consumable logic is consolidated in this one component. A consumable has five properties: the number of seconds it takes to consume or use the item, the animation to play while consuming, the sound to play while consuming, whether particles should appear during consumption, and the [effects to apply once the consumption is complete](#consumeeffect).

A `Consumable` can be applied using the `food` item property. If only the `Consumable` should be added, then `component` should be called. A list of vanilla consumables and builders can be found in `Consumables`.

```java
// For some item
Item exampleItem = new Item(new Item.Properties().component(DataComponents.CONSUMABLE,
    Consumable.builder()
    .consumeSeconds(1.6f) // Will use the item in 1.6 seconds, or 32 ticks
    .animation(ItemUseAnimation.EAT) // The animation to play while using
    .sound(SoundEvents.GENERIC_EAT) // The sound to play while using the consumable
    .soundAfterConsume(SoundEvents.GENERIC_DRINK) // The sound to play after consumption (delegates to 'onConsume')
    .hasConsumeParticles(true) // Sets whether to display particles
    .onConsume(
        // When finished consuming, applies the effects with a 30% chance
        new ApplyStatusEffectsConsumeEffect(new MobEffectInstance(MobEffects.HUNGER, 600, 0), 0.3F)
    )
    // Can have multiple
    .onConsume(
        // Teleports the entity randomly in a 50 block radius
        // NOTE: CURRENTLY BUGGED, only allows for 8 block raidus
        new TeleportRandomlyConsumeEffect(100f)
    )
    .build()
));
```

#### `OnOverrideSound`

Sometimes, an entity may want to play a different sound when consuming an item. In that case, the entity can implement `Consumable$OverrideConsumeSound` and return the sound event that should be played.

```java
// On your own entity
public class MyEntity extends Mob implements Consumable.OverrideCustomSound {
    // ...

    @Override
    public SoundEvent getConsumeSound(ItemStack stack) {
        // Return the sound event to play
    }
}
```

### `ConsumableListener`

`ConsumableListener`s are data components that indicate an action to apply once the stack has been 'consumed'. This means whenever `Consumable#consumeTicks` has passed since the player started using the consumable. An example of this would be `FoodProperties`. `ConsumableListener` only has one method `#onConsume` that takes in the level, entity, stack doing the consumption, and the `Consumable` that has finished being consumed.

```java
// On your own data component
public record MyDataComponent() implements ConsumableListener {

    // ...

    @Override
    public void onConsume(Level level, LivingEntity entity, ItemStack stack, Consumable consumable) {
        // Perform stuff once the item has been consumed.
    }
}
```

### `ConsumeEffect`

There is now a data component that handles what happens when an item is consumed by an entity, aptly called a `ConsumeEffect`. The current effects range from adding/removing mob effects, teleporting the player randomly, or simply playing a sound. These are applied by passing in the effect to the `Consumable` or `onConsume` in the builder.

```java
// When constructing a consumable
Consumable exampleConsumable = Consumable.builder()
    .onConsume(
        // When finished consuming, applies the effects with a 30% chance
        new ApplyStatusEffectsConsumeEffect(new MobEffectInstance(MobEffects.HUNGER, 600, 0), 0.3F)
    )
    // Can have multiple
    .onConsume(
        // Teleports the entity randomly in a 50 block radius
        // NOTE: CURRENTLY BUGGED, only allows for 8 block raidus
        new TeleportRandomlyConsumeEffect(100f)
    )
    .build();
```

### On Use Conversion

Converting an item into another stack on consumption is now handled through `DataComponents#USE_REMAINDER`. The remainder will only be converted if the stack is empty after this use. Otherwise, it will return the current stack, just with one item used.

```java
// For some item
Item exampleItem = new Item(new Item.Properties().usingConvertsTo(
    Items.APPLE // Coverts this into an apple on consumption
)); 
Item exampleItem2 = new Item(new Item.Properties().component(DataComponents.USE_REMAINDER,
    new UseCooldown(
        new ItemStack(Items.APPLE, 3) // Converts into three apples on consumption
    )
));
```

### Cooldowns

Item cooldowns are now handled through `DataComponents#USE_COOLDOWN`; however, they have been expanded to apply cooldowns to stacks based on their defined group. A cooldown group either refers to the `Item` registry name if not specified, or a custom resource location. When applying the cooldown, it will store the cooldown instance on anything that matches the defined group. This means that, if a stack has some defined cooldown group, it will not be affected when a normal item is used.

```java
// For some item
Item exampleItem = new Item(new Item.Properties().useCooldown(
    60 // Wait 60 seconds
    // Will apply cooldown to items in the 'my_mod:example_item' group (assuming that's the registry name)
)); 
Item exampleItem2 = new Item(new Item.Properties().component(DataComponents.USE_COOLDOWN,
    new UseCooldown(
        60, // Wait 60 seconds
        // Will apply cooldown to items in the 'my_mod:custom_group' group
        Optional.of(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("my_mod", "custom_group"))
    )
));

## Registry Objcet Id, in the Properties?

When providing the `BlockBehaviour$Properties` to the `Block` or the `Item$Properties` to the `Item`, it must set the `ResourceKey` in the block directly by calling `#setId`. An error will be thrown if this is not set before passing in.

```java
new Block(BlockBehaviour.Properties.of()
    .setId(ResourceKey.create(Registries.BLOCK, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_block"))));

new BlockItem(exampleBlock, new Item.Properties()
    .useBlockDescriptionPrefix() // Makes the description id for a block item
    .setId(ResourceKey.create(Registries.ITEM, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_item"))));

new Item(new Item.Properties()
    .setId(ResourceKey.create(Registries.ITEM, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_item"))));
```

- `net.minecraft.world.item.Item$Properties`
    - `setId` - Sets the resource key of the item to get the default description and model from. This property must be set.
    - `useBlockDescriptionPrefix` - Creates the description id using the `block.` prefix.
    - `useItemDescriptionPrefix` - Creates the description id using the `item.` prefix.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour$Properties#setId` - Sets the resource key of the block to get the default drops and description from. This property must be set.

## Properties Changes

`DirectionProperty` has been removed, and must now be called and referenced via `EnumProperty#create` with a `Direction` generic. Additionally, all property classes have been made final and must be constructed through one of the exposed `create` methods.

- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.properties`
    - `BooleanProperty` is now final
    - `DirectionProperty` class is removed
    - `EnumProperty` is now final
        - `create` now takes in a `List` instead of a `Collection`
    - `IntegerProperty` is now final
    - `Property#getPossibleValues` now returns a `List` instead of a `Collection`

## Recipes, now in Registry format

Recipes have been upgraded to a data pack registry, similar to how loot tables are handled. They are still queried in the same fashion, it just simply using a pseudo-registry-backed instance. Some of the more common changes is that `RecipeHolder` may be replaced by `RecipeDisplayId`, `RecipeDisplay`, or `RecipeDisplayEntry` if the holder itself is not needed. With this, there are a few changes to how recipe books are handled.

### Recipe Books

`RecipeBookComponent`s have been modified somewhat to hold a generic instance of the menu to render. As such, the component no longer implements `PlacedRecipe` and instead takes in a generic representing the `RecipeBookMenu`. The menu is passed into the component via its constructor instead of through the `init` method. This also menas that `RecipeBookMenu` does not have any associated generics. To create a component, the class needs to be extended.

```java
// Assume some MyRecipeMenu extends AbstractContainerMenu
public class MyRecipeBookComponent extends RecipeBookComponent<MyRecipeMenu> {

    public MyRecipeBookComponent(MyRecipeMenu menu, List<RecipeBookComponent.TabInfo> tabInfos) {
        super(menu, tabInfos);
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    protected void initFilterButtonTextures() {
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean isCraftingSlot(Slot slot) {
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    protected void selectMatchingRecipes(RecipeCollection collection, StackedItemContents contents) {
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    protected Component getRecipeFilterName() {
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    protected void fillGhostRecipe(GhostSlots slots, RecipeDisplay display, ContextMap ctx) {

    }
}

public class MyContainerScreen extends AbstractContainerScreen<MyRecipeMenu> implements RecipeUpdateListener {

    public MyContainerScreen(MyRecipeMenu menu, List<RecipeBookComponent.TabInfo> tabInfos, ...) {
        super(menu, ...);
        this.recipeBookComponent = new MyRecipeBookComponent(menu, tabInfos);
    }
    

    // See AbstractFurnaceScreen for a full implementation
}
```

### Recipe Displays

However, how does a recipe understand what should be displayed in a recipe book? This falls under two new static registries: the `RecipeDisplay` and the `SlotDisplay`.

The `SlotDisplay` represents what displays in a single slot within a recipe. The display only has one method (ignoring types): `resolve`. `resolve` takes in the `ContextMap` holding the data and the `DisplayContentsFactory` which accepts the stacks and remainders that will be displayed in this slot. `SlotDisplay` also has a lot of helper implementations, such as `$Composite` that takes in a list of displays or `$ItemStackSlotDisplay` that takes in the stack to display. The display is registered by its `$Type`, which takes in the map codec and stream codec.

The slot also has methods to get for the associated stacks that can be displayed via `resolveForStacks` and `resolveForFirstStack`.

```java
public static record MySlotDisplay() implements SlotDisplay {

    @Override
    public <T> Stream<T> resolve(ContextMap ctx, DisplayContentsFactory<T> output) {
        // Call output.forStack(...) or addRemainder(..., ...) using instanceof to display items
        if (output instanceof ForStacks<T> stacks) {
            stacks.forStack(...);
        } else if (output instanceof ForRemainders<T> remainders) {
            remainders.addRemainder(..., ...);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public SlotDisplay.Type<? extends SlotDisplay> type() {
        // Return the registered object here registered to Registries#SLOT_DISPLAY
    }
}
```

`RecipeDisplay` represents how a recipe is displayed. As an implementation detail, the `RecipeDisplay` only needs to be aware of the result (via `result` slot display) and the place the recipe is being used (via `craftingStation` slot display) as those are the only two details the recipe book cares about. However, it is recommended to also have slot displays for the ingredients and then have those consumed by your `RecipeBookComponent`. The display is registered by its `$Type`, which takes in the map codec and stream codec.


```java
public record MyRecipeDisplay(SlotDisplay result, SlotDisplay craftingStation, ...) implements RecipeDisplay {

    @Override
    public RecipeDisplay.Type<? extends RecipeDisplay> type() {
        // Return the registered object here registered to Registries#RECIPE_DISPLAY
    }
}
```

### Recipe Placements

Recipe ingredients and placements within the recipe book are now handled through `Recipe#placementInfo`. A `PlacementInfo` is basically a definition of items the recipe contains and where they should be placed within the menu if supported. If the recipe cannot be placed, such as if it is not an `Item` or uses stack information, then it should return `PlacementInfo#NOT_PLACEABLE`.

A `PlacementInfo` can be created either from an `Ingredient`, a `List<Ingredient>`, or a `List<Optional<Ingredient>>` using `create` or `createFromOptionals`, respectively.

```java
public class MyRecipe implements Recipe<RecipeInput> {

    private PlacementInfo info;

    public MyRecipe(Ingredient input) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...

    @Override
    public PlacementInfo placementInfo() {
        // This delegate is done as the HolderSet backing the ingredient may not be fully populated in the constructor
        if (this.info == null) {
            this.info = PlacementInfo.create(input);
        }

        return this.info;
    }
}
```

If an `Optional<Ingredient>` is used, they can be tested via `Ingredient#testOptionalIngredient`.

- `net.minecraft.world.item.crafting`
    - `Ingredient#display` - Returns the `SlotDisplay` that shows this ingredient.
    - `PlacementInfo` - Defines all ingredients necessary to construct the result of a recipe.
    - `Recipe`
        - `getToastSymbol` -> `getCategoryIconItem`
        - `getIngredients`, `isIncomplete` -> `placementInfo`
            - `getIngredients` -> `PlacementInfo#stackedRecipeContents`,
            - `isIncomplete` -> `PlacementInfo#isImpossibleToPlace`
    - `RecipeManager#getSynchronizedRecipes` - Returns all recipes that can be placed and sends them to the client. No other recipes are synced.
    - `ShapedRecipePattern` now takes in a `List<Optional<Ingredient>>` instead of a `NonNullList<Ingredient>`
    - `ShapelessRecipe` now takes in a `List<Ingredient>` instead of a `NonNullList<Ingredient>`
    - `SmithingTransformRecipe`, `SmithingTrimRecipe` now takes in `Optional<Ingredient>`s instead of `Ingredient`s
    - `SuspiciousStewRecipe` class is removed

### Recipe Changes

There have been a few changes within the recipe class itself, which mirror all of the above changes. First, `canCraftInDimensions` is removed and now hardcoded into the match function. `getResultItem` and `getCategoryIconItem` has been replaced by `RecipeDisplay` via `display`. `getRemainingItems` has moved to `CraftingRecipe`. Finally, all recipes now return their `RecipeBookCategory` via `recipeBookCategory`.

```java
public class MyRecipe implements Recipe<RecipeInput> {

    @Override
    public String group() {
        // Return here what `getGroup` was
    }

    @Override
    public List<RecipeDisplay> display() {
        return List.of(
            // Some recipe display instance
            // RecipeDisplay#result should return `getResultItem`
            // RecipeDisplay#craftingStation should return `getCategoryIconItem`
        )
    }

    @Override
    public RecipeBookCategory recipeBookCategory() {
        // Functions similar to the book category passed into the recipe builders during data generation
        return RecipeBookCategories.CRAFTING_MISC;
    }
}
```

### Creating Recipe Book Categories

Recipe book categories are unified by `ExtendedRecipeBookCategory` and split into two sections: `RecipeBookCategory` for actual categories, and `SearchRecipeBookCategory` for aggregate categories. While `SearchRecipeBookCategory`s are enums, `RecipeBookCategory` is like any other static registry object. This is done by creating a new `RecipeBookCategory`.

```java
// Using the standard vanilla registry method
public static final RecipeBookCategory EXAMPLE_CATEGORY = Registry.register(
    BuiltInRegistries.RECIPE_BOOK_CATEGORY,
    // The registry object name
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_category"),
    // This creates a new recipe book category. It functions as a marker object.
    new RecipeBookCategory()
);
```

## Minor Migrations

The following is a list of useful or interesting additions, changes, and removals that do not deserve their own section in the primer.

### Language File Removals and Renames

All removals and renames to translations keys within `assets/minecraft/lang` are now shown in a `deprecated.json`.

### Critereons, Supplied with HolderGetters

All critereon builders during construction now take in a `HolderGetter`. While this may not be used, this is used instead of a direct call to the static registry to grab associated `Holder`s and `HolderSet`s.

- `net.minecraft.advancement.critereon`
    - `BlockPredicate$Builder#of`
    - `ConsumeItemTrigger$TriggerInstance#usedItem`

### Smarter Framerate Limiting

Instead of simply limiting the framerate when the player is not in a level or when in a screen or overlay, there is different behavior depending on different actions. This is done using the `InactivityFpsLimit` via the `FramerateLimitTracker`. This adds two additional checks. If the window is minimized, the game runs at 10 fps. If the user provides no input for a minute, then the game runs at 30 fps. 10 fps after ten minutes of no input.

- `com.mojang.blaze3d.platform.FramerateLimitTracker` - A tracker that limits the framerate based on the set value.
- `com.mojang.blaze3d.platform#Window#setFramerateLimit`, `getFramerateLimit` is removed
- `net.minecraft.client`
    - `InactivityFpsLimit` - An enum that defines how the FPS should be limited when the window is minimzed or the player is away from keyboard.
    - `Minecraft#getFramerateLimitTracker` - Returns the framerate limiter.

### Fuel Values

`FuelValues` has replaced the static map within `AbstractFurnaceBlockEntity`. This functions the same as that map, except the fuel values are stored on the `MinecraftServer` itself and made available to individual `Level` instances. The map can be obtained with access to the `MinecraftServer` or `Level` and calling the `fuelValues` method.

- `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer.ClientPacketListener#fuelValues` - Returns the burn times for fuel.
- `net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#fuelValues` - Returns the burn times for fuel.
- `net.minecraft.server.level.Level#fuelValues` - Returns the burn times for fuel.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity`
    - `AbstractFurnaceBlockEntity`
        - `invalidateCache`, `getFuel` -> `Level#fuelValues`
        - `getBurnDuration` now takes in the `FuelValues`
        - `isFuel` -> `FuelValues#isFuel`
    - `FuelValues` - A class which holds the list of fuel items and their associated burn times

### Light Emissions

Light emission data is now baked into the quad and can be added to a face using the `light_emission tag`.

- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.block.model`
    - `BakedQuad` now takes in an `int` representing the light emission
        - `getLightEmission` - Returns the light emission of a quad.
    - `BlockElement` now takes in an `int` representing the light emission
    - `FaceBakery#bakeQuad` now takes in an `int` representing the light emission

### Map Textures

Map textures are now handled through the `MapTextureManager`, which handles the dynamic texture, and the `MapRenderer`, which handles the map rendering. Map decorations are still loaded through the `map_decorations` sprite folder.

- `net.minecraft.client`
    - `Minecraft`
        - `getMapRenderer` - Gets the renderer for maps.
        - `getMapTextureManager` - Gets the texture manager for maps.
- `net.minecraft.client.resources#MapTextureManager` - Handles creating the dynamic texture for the map.
- `net.minecraft.client.gui.MapRenderer` -> `net.minecraft.client.renderer.MapRenderer`
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer#GameRenderer#getMapRenderer` -> `Minecraft#getMapRenderer`

### Orientations

With the edition of the redstone wire experiments comes a new class provided by the neighbor changes: `Orientation`. `Orientation` is effectively a combination of two directions and a side bias. `Orientation` is used as a way to propogate updates relative to the connected directions and biases of the context. Currently, this means nothing for people not using the new redstone wire system as all other calls to neighbor methods set this to `null`. However, it does provide a simple way to propogate behavior in a stepwise manner.


- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.debug.RedstoneWireOrientationsRenderer` - A debug renderer for redstone wires being oriented.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.Level`
    - `updateNeighborsAt` - Updates the neighbor at the given position with the specified `Orientation`.

    - `getBlockSignal` - Returns the strength of the block signal.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour`
    - `neighborChanged`, `$BlockStateBase#handleNeighborChanged` now takes in an `Orientation` instead of the neighbor `BlockPos`
    - `updateShape` now takes in the `LevelReader`, `ScheduledTickAccess`, and a `RandomSource` instead of the `LevelAccessor`; the `Direction` and `BlockState` parameters are reordered
    - `$BlockStateBase#updateShape` now takes in the `LevelReader`, `ScheduledTickAccess`, and a `RandomSource` instead of the `LevelAccessor`; the `Direction` and `BlockState` parameters are reordered
- `net.minecraft.world.level.redstone`
    - `CollectingNeighborUpdater$ShapeUpdate#state` -> `neighborState`
    - `NeighborUpdater`
        - `neighborChanged`, `updateNeighborsAtExceptFromFacing`, `executeUpdate` now takes in an `Orientation` instead of the neighbor `BlockPos`
        - `executeShapeUpdate` switches the order of the `BlockState` and neighbor `BlockPos`
    - `Orientation` - A group of connected `Directions` on a block along with a bias towards either the front or the up side.
    - `RedstoneWireEvaluator` - A strength evaluator for incoming and outgoing signals.

### Minecart Behavior

Minecarts now have a `MinecartBehavior` class that handles how the entity should be moved and rendered.

- `net.minecraft.core.dispenser.MinecartDispenseItemBehavior` - Defines how a minecart should behave when dispensed from a dispenser.
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.vehicle`
    - `AbstractMinecart`
        - `getMinecartBehavior` - Returns the behavior of the minecart.
        - `exits` is now public
        - `isFirstTick` - Returns whether this is the first tick the entity is alive.
        - `getCurrentBlockPosOrRailBelow` - Gets the current position of the minecart or the rail beneath.
        - `moveAlongTrack` -> `makeStepAlongTrack`
        - `setOnRails` - Sets whether the minecart is on rails.
        - `isFlipped`, `setFlipped` - Returns whetherh the minecart is upside down.
        - `getRedstoneDirection` - Returns the direction the redstone is powering to.
        - `isRedstoneConductor` is now public
        - `applyNaturalSlowdown` now returns the vector to slowdown by.
        - `getPosOffs` -> `MinecartBehavior#getPos`
        - `setInitialPos` - Sets the initial position of the minecart.
        - `createMinecart` is now abstract in its creation, meaning it can be used to create any minecart given the provided parameters
        - `getMinecartType` is removed
        - `getPickResult` is now abstract
        - `$Type` and `getMinecartType` is replaced by `isRideable` and `isFurnace`, which is not one-to-one.

    - `MinecartBehavior` - holds how the entity should be rendered and positions during movement.
    - `MinecartFurnace#xPush`, `zPush` -> `push`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.properties.RailShape#isAscending` -> `isSlope`
- `net.minecraft.world.phys.shapes.MinecartCollisionContext` - An entity collision context that handles the collision of a minecart with some other collision object.

### EXPLOOOOSSSION!

`Explosion` is now an interface that defines the metadata of the explosion. It does not contain any method to actually explode itself. However, `ServerExplosion` is still used internally to handle level explosions and the like.

- `net.minecraft.world.level`
    - `Explosion` -> `ServerExplosion`
    - `Explosion` - An interface that defines how an explosion should occur.
        - `getDefaultDamageSource` - Returns the default damage source of the explosion instance.
        - `shouldAffectBlocklikeEntities` - Returns whether block entites should be affected by the explosion.
        - `level` - Gets the `ServerLevel`
    - `ExplosionDamageCalculator#getEntityDamageAmount` now takes in an additional `float` representing the seen percent
    - `Level#explode` no longer returns anything

- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour#onExplosionHit`, `$BlockStateBase#onExplosionHit` now takes in a `ServerLevel` instead of a `Level`


### The Removal of the Carving Generation Step

`GenerationStep$Carving` has been removed, meaning that all `ConfiguredWorldCarver`s are provided as part of a single `HolderSet`.

```json
// In some BiomeGenerationSettings JSON
{
    "carvers": [
        // Carvers here
    ]
}
```

- `net.minecraft.world.level.biome.BiomeGenerationSettings`
    - `getCarvers` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`
    - `$Builder#addCarver` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`
    - `$PlainBuilder#addCarver` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.chunk`
    - `ChunkGenerator#applyCarvers` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`
    - `ProtoChunk#getCarvingMask`, `getOrCreateCarvingMask`, `setCarvingMask` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.placement`
    - `CarvingMaskPlacement` class is removed
    - `PlacementContext#getCarvingMask` no longer takes in a `GenerationStep$Carving`

### Codecable Json Reload Listener

The `SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener` has been rewritten to use codecs instead of pure `Gson`.

```java
public class MyJsonListener extends SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener<MyJsonObject> {

    // If you do not need registry access, the HolderLookup$Provider parameter can be removed
    public MyJsonListener(HolderLookup.Provider registries, Codec<T> codec, String directory) {
        super(registries, codec, directory);
    }
}
```

- `net.minecraft.server.packs.resources.SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener` now takes in a generic representing the data object of the JSON
    - The constructor is now protected, taking in the codec of the data object, the string of the directory, and an optional `HolderLookup$Provider` to construct the `RegistryOps` serialization context as necessary
    - `prepare` now returns a map of names to objects
    - `scanDirectory` now takes in the `DynamicOps` and `Codec`

### Consecutive Executors

`ProcessorMailbox` and `ProcessorHandle` have been replaced with `AbstractConsecutiveExecutor` and `TaskScheduler`, respectively. These are effectively the same in their usage, just with potentially different method names.

- `net.minecraft.util.thread`
    - `ProcessorMailbox` -> `AbstractConsecutiveExecutor`, not one-to-one
        - `ConsecutiveExecutor` would be the equivalent implementation
    - `PriorityConsecutiveExecutor` - An executor that specifies the priority of the task to run when scheduling.
    - `BlockableEventLoop#wrapRunnable` -> `AbstractConsecutiveExecutor#wrapRunnable`
    - `ProcessorHandle` -> `TaskScheduler`, where the generic is a subtype of `Runnable`
        - `tell` -> `schedule`
        - `ask`, `askEither` -> `scheduleWithResult`, not one-to-one
        - `of` -> `wrapExecutor`
    - `StrictQueue` no longer takes in an `F` generic and makes `T` a subtype of `Runnable`
        - `pop` now returns a `Runnable`
        - `$IntRunnable` -> `$RunnableWithPriority`


### Mob Conversions

Mobs, converted via `#convertTo`, have their logic handled by `ConversionType`, `ConversionParams`. `ConversionType` is an enum that dictates the logic to apply when copying the information from one mob to another via `#convert`. The common properties are handled via `#convertCommon`, which is called within the `#convert` method. There are currently two types: `SINGLE`, where the entity is converted one-to-one to another entity; and `SPLIT_ON_DEATH`, where the `Mob#convertTo` method is called mutiple times such as when a slime dies. `ConversionParams` contains the metadata about the conversion process: the type, whether the entity can keep its equipment or pick up loot, and what team the entity is on. `Mob#convertTo` also takes in a mob consumer to apply any finalization settings to the entity itself.

```java
// For some Mob exampleMob
exampleMob.convertTo(
    EntityType.SHEEP, // The entity to convert to
    new ConversionParams(
        ConversionType.SINGLE, // One-to-one
        true, // Keep equipment
        false // Do not preserve pick up loot
    ),
    EntitySpawnReason.CONVERSION, // Reason entity spawned
    sheep -> {
        // Perform any other settings to set on the newly converted entity
    },
)
```

- `net.minecraft.world.entity`
    - `ConversionParams` - A record containing the settings of what happens when a mob is converted to another entity
    - `ConversionType` - An enum that defines how one mob is transformed to another. Currently either `SINGLE` for one-to-one, or `SPLIT_ON_DEATH` for one-to-many (only used for slimes)
    - `Mob#convertTo` now takes in the `ConversionParams`, an optional `EntitySpawnReason` of the entity (default `CONVERSION`), and a mob consumer to set any other information after conversion

### Ender Pearl Chunk Loading

Ender pearls now load the chunks they cross through by adding a ticket to the chunk source and storing the entity on the player.

- `net.minecraft.server.level.ServerPlayer`
    - `registerEnderPearl`, `deregisterEnderPearl`, `getEnderPearls` - Handles the ender pearls thrown by the player.
    - `registerAndUpdateEnderPearlTicket`, `placeEnderPearlTicket` - Handles the region tickets for the thrown ender pearls.

### Profilers and the Tracy Client

Profilers have been separated from the minecraft instance, now obtained through `Profiler#get`. A new profiler instance can be added via a try-resource block on `Profiler#use`. In addition, the profiler addds a new library called Tracy, made to track the current stack frame along with capturing images on the screen, if the associated `--tracy` argument is passed in. These sections can be split into 'zones' to more granularly distinguish what is happening.

```java
Profiler.get().push("section");
// Do code here
Profiler.get().pop();
```

- `com.mojang.blaze3d.systems.RenderSystem#flipFrame` now takes in a `TracyFrameCapture`, or `null`
- `net.minecraft.client.Minecraft#getProfiler` -> `Profiler#get`
- `net.minecraft.client.main.GameConfig$GameData` now takes in a boolean on whether to capture the screen via the tracy client.
- `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer.ClientLevel` no longer takes in the `ProfilerFiller`
- `net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#getProfiler` -> `Profiler#get`
- `net.minecraft.server.packs.resources.PreparableReloadListener#reload` no longer takes in the `ProfilerFiller`s
- `net.minecraft.util.profiling`
    - `Profiler` - A static handler for managing the currently active `ProfilerFiller`.
    - `ProfilerFiller`
        - `addZoneText` - Adds text to label when profiling the current frame.
        - `addZoneValue` - Adds the value of the zone when profiling the current frame.
        - `setZoneColor` - Sets the color of the zone when profiling the current frame.
        - `zone` - Adds a profiler section while creating a new zone to call the above methods for.
        - `tee` -> `combine`
        - `$CombinedProfileFiller` - A profiler that writes to multiple profilers.
    - `TracyZoneFiller` - A profiler used by the tracy client to keep track of the currently profiling zones.
    - `Zone` - A section that is current being profiled and interpreted by Tracy.
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.ai.goal.GoalSelector` no longer takes in the supplied `ProfilerFiller`

    - `PathNavigationRegion#getProfiler` -> `Profiler#get`
- `net.minecraft.world.ticks.LevelTicks` no longer takes in the `ProfilerFiller`

### Tick Throttler

To prevent the player from spamming certain actions, `TickThrottler` was added. The throttler takes in the threshold and the increment to add to the count. If the count is less than the threshold, the action can occur. The count is reduced every tick.

- `net.minecraft.util.TickThrottler` - A utility for throttling certain actions from happening too often.

### Context Keys

Loot context parameters have been replaced with Context keys, which is simply a more general naming scheme for the previous classes. This also caused the context keys to be used in other contexts that may have arbitrary data.

For a brief description, the context key system is effectively a general typed dictionary, where each `ContextKey` holds the value type, which is then stored in a backed-map within a `ContextMap`. To enforce required and optional parameters, a `ContextMap` is built with a `ContextKeySet`, which defines the keys of the dictionary map.

- `net.minecraft.advancements.critereon.CriterionValidator#validate` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
- `net.minecraft.data.loot.LootTableProvider$SubProviderEntry#paramSet` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
- `net.minecraft.util.context`
    - `ContextKey` - A key that represents an object. It can be thought of a dictionary key that specifies the value type.
    - `ContextKeySet` - A key set which indicates what keys the backing dictionary must have, along with optional keys that can be specified.
    - `ContextMap` - A map of context keys to their typed objects.

    - `ConditionalEffect#codec` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a`LootContextParamSet`
    - `TargetedConditionalEffect#codec` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a`LootContextParamSet`

        - `hasParam`, `getParameter`, `getOptionalParameter`, `getParamOrNull` are accessible through the `ContextMap` under different names
        - `$Builder#withParameter`, `withOptionalParameter`, `getParameter`, `getOptionalParameter` now takes in a `ContextKey` instead of a `LootContextParam`
        - `$Builder#create` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
    - `LootTable`
        - `getParameSet` now returns a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
        - `$Builder#setParamSet` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
    - `ValidationContext` now takes in a `ContextKeySet` instead of a `LootContextParamSet`
        - `validateUser` -> `validateContextUsage`
        - `setParams` - `setContextKeySet`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.storage.loot.functions`
    - `CopyComponentsFunction$Source#getReferencedContextParams` now takes in a set of `ContextKey`s rather than a set of `LootContextParam`s
- `net.minecraft.world.level.storage.loot.parameters`

    - `LootContextParamSet` -> `net.minecraft.util.context.ContextKeySet`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.storage.loot.providers.nbt`
    - `ContextNbtProvider$Getter#getReferencedContextParams` now takes in a set of `ContextKey`s rather than a set of `LootContextParam`s
    - `NbtProvider#getReferencedContextParams` now takes in a set of `ContextKey`s rather than a set of `LootContextParam`s
- `net.minecraft.world.level.storage.loot.providers.score.ScoreboardNameProvider#getReferencedContextParams` now takes in a set of `ContextKey`s rather than a set of `LootContextParam`s
