## Pack Changes

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=1.21.6&tab=changelog).

## GUI Changes

The GUI rendering system has significantly changed from the previous version. While it may seem somewhat similar on the surface, the actual implementation details are much more complex and roundabout. This will explain a high-level overview of the new system with some basic examples.

### Prepare and Render

Rendering a GUI has been broken into two phases: 'prepare' and 'render'.

The prepare phase is what we typically consider the GUI render methods (e.g., `Gui#render`, `AbstractContainerScreen#renderBg`, etc.). These methods, instead of actually rendering the components, now submit them to the `GuiRenderState` to be stored for use during the 'render' phase. The `GuiRenderState` is stored on the `GameRenderer` and passed to the `GuiGraphics` which uses the previous methods to add the desired objects to the render state.

The render phase is what actually handles the rendering of all the objects. This is handled through the `GuiRenderer`, which reads the data from the `GuiRenderState` and, after a bit of delegated preparation and sorting, renders the objects to the screen. The `GuiRenderer` is also stored on the `GameRenderer`.

### Element Ordering

Now, how are elements rendered onto screen? In the previous versions, this happened mainly based on the order of the render calls. However, the new system using two different methods of sorting. The first method handles the depth using strata and a linear tree. The second method uses a comparator based on three things (in order of priorty): the `ScreenRectangle` scissor, the `RenderPipeline` order, and the `TextureSetup`'s hash code. These are all stored on the `GuiElementRenderState` passed to the `GuiRenderState` via `GuiRenderState#submitGuiElement`.

Once the elements have been ordered, they are rendered starting at a Z of `0`, with each element rendered `0.01` ahead of the previous.

As a warning, due to the element sort order, certain custom configurations may result in incorrect screen renders. As such, it is imperative that you understand how the methods and their assigned values work when sorting elements.

#### Strata and Trees

The first method of sorting handles the z-depth an object is rendered at.

First let's start with the linear tree. As the name implies, it is basically a doubly-linked `GuiRenderState$Node` list. Each node contains its own list of elements to render. Navigating the node list is handled using `GuiRenderState#up` or `down`, where each either gets the next node, or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. Nodes within a given tree are rendered from bottom to top, meaning that `down` will render any elements submitted before the current node, while `up` will render any elements submitted after the current node.

Determinining what node an object is added to is computed automatically when submitting an element using its `ScreenArea`. The `ScreenArea` defines the `bounds` of your element to be rendered. Essentially, a node will be added in the `up` direction if the bounds of the element intersect with any other element on the current node.

Then there are strata. A stratum is essentially a linear tree. Strata are rendered in the order they are created, which means calling `nextStratum` will render all elements after the previous stratum. This can be used if you want to group elements into a specific layer. Note: you cannot navigate to a prior stratum.

#### The Comparator

The comparator handles sorting the elements within a given node in a linear tree in a strata.

##### Screen Rectangle Scissor

The `ScreenRectangle` is simply the area that the element is allowed to draw to, stored via `GuiElementRenderState#scissorArea`. Elements with no specified `ScreenRectangle` will be ordered first, followed by the minimum Y, the maximum Y, the minimum X, and the maximum X.

##### Render Pipeline

`RenderPipeline`s define the pipeline used to render some object to the screen, including its shaders, format, uniforms, etc. This is stored via `GuiElementRenderState#pipeline`. Pipelines are sorted in the order they are built. This means that `RenderPipelines#ENTITY_TRANSLUCENT` will be rendered before `RenderPipelines#GUI` if on the same layer and scissor rectangle. As this is a system that relies on classloading constants, if you want to add new elements, make sure your mod loader supports some kind of dynamic pipeline ordering.

##### Texture Hash Code

`TextureSetup` defines `Sampler0`, `Sampler1`, and `Sampler2` for use in the render pipelines, stored via `GuiElementRenderState#textureSetup`. Elements with no textures will be ordered first, followed by `getSortKey` of the record object. Note that, at the moment, this returns the `hashCode` of the `TextureSetup`, which may be non-deterministic as `GpuTextureView` does not implement `hashCode`, relying instead on the identity object hash.

### GuiElementRenderState

Now that we understand ordering, what exactly is the `GuiElementRenderState` that we've been using? Well essentially, every object rendered to the screen is represented by a `GuiElementRenderState`, from the player seen in the inventory menu to each individual item. A `GuiElementRenderState` defines four methods. First, there are the common ones used for ordering and how to render to the screen (`pipeline`, `scissorArea`, `textureSetup`, `bounds`). Then there is `buildVertices`, which takes in the `VertexConsumer` to write the vertices to and the z-depth. For GUIs, this typically calls `VertexConsumer#addVertexWith2DPose`.

There are three types of `GuiElementRenderState`s provided by vanilla: `BlitRenderState`, `ColoredRectangleRenderState`, `GlyphEffectRenderState`, and `GlyphRenderState`. `ColoredRectangleRenderState` and `GlyphRenderState`/`GlyphEffectRenderState` are simple cases for handling a basic color rectangle and text character, respectively. `BlitRenderState` covers every other case as almost every method eventually writes to a `GpuTexture` which is then consumed by this.

`GuiElementRenderState`s are added to the `GuiRenderState` via `GuiRenderState$Node#submitGuiElement`. The `GuiRenderState` makes `submitBlitToCurrentLayer` and `submitGlyphToCurrentLayer` available to add textures and glyphs. For example, these are called by `GuiGraphics#*line`, `fill`, and `blit*` methods.

#### GuiItemRenderState

`GuiItemRenderState` is a special case used to render an item to the screen. It takes in the stringified name of the item, the current pose, its XY coordinates, and its scissor area. The `ItemStackRenderState` it holds is what defines how the item is rendered. The rendering bounds are computed based on the item model bounding box when `ClientItem$Properties#oversizedInGui` is true; otherwise, using a 16x16 square when false.

Just before the 'render' phase, the `GuiRenderer` effectively turns the `GuiItemRenderState` into a `GuiElementRenderState`, more specifically a `BlitRenderState`. This is done by constructing an item atlas `GpuTexture` which the item is drawn to, and then that texture is submitted as a `BlitRenderState`. All `GuiItemRenderState`s use `RenderPipelines#GUI_TEXTURED_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA`.

`GuiElementRenderState`s are added to the `GuiRenderState` via `GuiRenderState#submitItem`. This is called by `GuiGraphics#render*Item*` methods.

#### GuiTextRenderState

`GuiTextRenderState` is a special case used to render text to the screen. It takes in the `Font`, `FormattedCharSequence`, current pose, its XY coordinates, color, background color, whether it has a drop shadow, and its rendering bounds.

Just before the 'render' phase, the `GuiRenderer` turns the `GuiTextRenderState` into a `GuiElementRenderState`, more specifically a `GlyphRenderState` or `GlyphEffectRenderState` depending on what should be rendered via `GuiTextRenderState#ensurePrepared`. This performs a similar process as the item render state where the text is written to a `GpuTexture` to be consumed. Any backgrounds are rendered first, followed by the background effects, then the character, then finally the foreground effects.

`GuiElementRenderState`s are added to the `GuiRenderState` via `GuiRenderState#submitText`. This is called by `GuiGraphics#draw*String` and `render*Tooltip` methods.

#### Picture-in-Picture

Picture-in-Picture is a special case used to render arbitrary objects to a `GpuTexture` to be passed into a `BlitRenderState`. A Picture-in-Picture is made up of two components the `PictureInPictureRenderState`, and the `PictureInPictureRenderer`.

`PictureInPictureRenderState` is an interface which can store some data used to render the object to the texture. By default, it must supply the minimum and maximum XY coordinates, the texture scale, its scissor area, and its rendering bounds. You can also choose to specify the transformation matrix via `pose`. Any other data can be added by the implementor.

```java
public record ExamplePIPRenderState(boolean data, int x0, int x1, int y0, int y1, float scale, @Nullable ScreenRectangle scissorArea, @Nullable ScreenRectangle bounds)
    implements PictureInPictureRenderState {}
```

`PictureInPictureRenderer` is the renderer which writes the data to the `GpuTexture`. It does this by taking advantage of the fact that the `RenderSystem#output*Override` textures are written to in a `BufferSource` if they are not null. A `PictureInPictureRenderer` method must implement three methods. `getRenderStateClass` returns the class of the `PictureInPictureRenderState` implementation. `getTextureLabel` returns the texture label for debugging purposes. `renderToTexture` is where the render logic is called to write the data to the texture. 

```java
public class ExamplePIPRenderer extends PictureInPictureRenderer<ExamplePIPRenderState> {

    // Takes in the buffer source from `RenderBuffers`
    public ExamplePIPRenderer(MultiBufferSource.BufferSource bufferSource) {
        super(bufferSource);
    }

    @Override
    public Class<ExamplePIPRenderState> getRenderStateClass() {
        // The class of the render state
        return ExamplePIPRenderState.class;
    }

    @Override
    protected void renderToTexture(ExamplePIPRenderState renderState, PoseStack pose) {
        // Render whatever you want here
        // You can make use of the buffer source via `this.bufferSource`
    }

    @Override
    protected void blitTexture(ExamplePIPRenderState renderState, GuiRenderState guiState) {
        // You can override this if you want to change how your layer is submitted to the render state
        // By default, this uses the `BlitRenderState`

        // Remove this if you want to handle submission yourself
        super.blitTexture(renderState, guiState);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean textureIsReadyToBlit(ExamplePIPRenderState renderState) {
        // When true, this will skip setting up the textures and projection matrices and use whatever is currently available
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    protected String getTextureLabel() {
        // This can be anything, but it should be unique
        return "examplemod: example pip";
    }
}
```

To be able to use the renderer, is must be added to `GuiRenderer#pictureInPictureRenderers`. As the constructor takes in an immutable list while the renderer stores an immutable map, use whatever method is provided by your mod loader.

```java
// We will assume:
// - `GuiRenderer#bufferSource` is accessible
// - The map is made mutable
// For some GuiRenderer renderer

var examplePIP = new ExamplePIPRenderer(renderer.bufferSource);

renderer.pictureInPictureRenderers.put(
    examplePIP.getRenderStateClass(),
    examplePIP
);
```

`PictureInPictureRenderState`s are added to the `GuiRenderState` via `GuiRenderState#submitPicturesInPictureState`. This is called by `GuiGraphics#submit*RenderState` methods.

### Logic Changes

`GuiGraphics#drawString` now joins the rest of the `GuiGraphics` methods by allowing the `int` color argument to accept an alpha channel (upper eight bits). This means that any color string without an alpha specified will not be rendered. Previous behavior can be replicated by ORing your `int` color with `0xFF000000` or by passing your color into `ARGB#opaque`.  

### Contextual Bars

Many HUD elements on the screen take over where the experience bar is rendered. However, how these are rendered and which one is prioritized is handled through the contextual bar system. A contextual bar is made up of two parts, the `ContextualBarRenderer`, responsible for rendering the bar to the screen, and the `Gui$ContextualInfo`, which is used as the bar's identifier.

A `ContextualBarRenderer` requires two methods to be implemented: `renderBackground`, which renders the bar itself, and `render`, which renders elements that appear on top of the bar.

```java
public class ExampleContextualBarRenderer implements ContextualBarRenderer {

    @Override
    public void renderBackground(GuiGraphics graphics, DeltaTracker delta) {
        // Render background bar sprites here
    }

    @Override
    public void render(GuiGraphics graphics, DeltaTracker delta) {
        // Render anything that might sit on top of the bar
    }
}
```

`Gui$ContextInfo` is an enum, so your mod loader will need to either allow extensions or some other method of identifying a bar renderer. Then, the renderer needs to be added to map of renderers stored in `Gui#contextualInfoBarRenderers`. As this is an immutable map, use whatever method is provided by your mod loader.

```java
// We will assume:
// - Created a new enum value `EXAMPLEMOD_EXAMPLE`
// - The map is made mutable
// For some Gui gui
gui.contextualInfoBarRenderers.put(
    EXAMPLEMOD_EXAMPLE,
    ExampleContextualBarRenderer::new
);
```

Finally, to get your bar to be called and prioritized, you need to modify `Gui#nextContextualInfoState` to return your enum value, or whatever method is provided by your mod loader.

### Dialogs

To more generally handle screens which provide some basic functionalities -- such as confirmation screens, button selection, or user input, Vanilla has provided a generic dialog system. These dialogs can be constructed in a datapack and delivered on the client by calling `Player#openDialog`. The basic JSON description is documented in  [Minecraft Snapshot 25w20a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w20a).

For a quick overiview, a basic `Dialog` contains the following components: a title, an optional external title for navigation, whether the screen can be closed by pressing 'esc', and its `DialogBody` contents. Everything else is determined by the dialog itself, but it has functionality for user inputs via `InputControl`s. Buttons are typically added through `ClickAction`s which hold the common button data and an event to execute on click. If the dialog is canceled (e.g., closed), then `onCancel` is run.

`DialogBody` and `InputControl` are simply generic interfaces that have no defined structure. Implementing them, or any dialog for that matter, requires some registration to the available types on both the client and server.

#### Custom Bodies

A `DialogBody` is simply the contents of a dialog screen. This is generally immutable information that should be displayed at all times. Every dialog holds a list of these `DialogBody`s as every screen has some text to explain what it is for. It only contains one method `mapCodec`, which is used as the registry key and encoder for the body information.

```java
// Obviously, a body would have actual contents, but this is simply an example implementation
public record ExampleDialogBody(boolean val1, int val2) implements DialogBody {
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleDialogBody> BODY_CODEC = RecordCodecBuilder.mapCodec(instance -> instance.group(
        Codec.BOOL.fieldOf("val1").forGetter(ExampleDialogBody::val1),
        Codec.INT.fieldOf("val2").forGetter(ExampleDialogBody::val2)
    ).apply(ExampleDialogBody::new));

    @Override
    public MapCodec<? extends DialogBody> mapCodec() {
        return BODY_CODEC;
    }
}

// Register the codec to the registry
Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.DIALOG_BODY_TYPE, "examplemod:example_body", ExampleDialogBody.BODY_CODEC);
```

```json5
// For some dialog
{
    // ...
    "body": [
        {
            // Our body
            "type": "examplemod:example_body",
            "val1": true,
            "val2": 0
        },
        // ...
    ]
}
```

How does this body actually render then? Well, that is done via a `DialogBodyHandler`. This contains a single method `createControls` that generates the `LayoutElement` to render given the `DialogScreen` and the dialog data. This body handler can be linked to the `MapCodec` via `DialogBodyHandlers#register`.

```java
public class ExampleDialogBodyHandler implements DialogBodyHandler<ExampleDialogBody> {

    @Override
    public LayoutElement createControls(DialogScreen<?> screen, ExampleDialogBody body) {
        // Create the element (widgets, layouts, etc.)
        return new StringWidget(...);
    }
}

// Note that `register` is not public, so this needs to be access widened
DialogBodyHandlers.register(BODY_CODEC, new ExampleDialogBodyHandler());
```

#### Custom Inputs

An `InputControl` represents some input a user can provide, whether that would be some text or a button submission click. This is generally made up of components that can accept or provide some string value or tag based on a state. All dialogs can provide these inputs; through the `DialogControlSet`. It only contains one method `mapCodec`, which is used as the registry key and encoder for the input control.

```java
public record ExampleInputControl(int value) implements InputControl {
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleInputControl> INPUT_CODEC = Codec.INT.fieldOf("value").xmap(
        ExampleInputControl::new, ExampleInputControl::value
    );

    @Override
    public MapCodec<? extends InputControl> mapCodec() {
        return INPUT_CODEC;
    }
}

// Register the codec to the registry
Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.INPUT_CONTROL_TYPE, "examplemod:example_input", ExampleInputControl.INPUT_CODEC);
```

```json5
// For some dialog (assume `minecraft:simple_input_form`)
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            // Our input
            "type": "examplemod:example_input",
            
            // The identifier for the data of this input
            "key": "example_input",

            "value": 0
        },
        // ...
    ]
}
```

Like above, the input is rendered via a `InputControlHandler`. This contains a single method `addControl`, which provides the `Screen` and input control and creates the `LayoutElement` and its associated `Action$ValueGetter` via `$Output`. This input handler can be linked to the `MapCodec` via `InputControlHandlers#register`.

```java
public class ExampleInputControlHandler implements InputControlHandler<ExampleInputControl> {

    @Override
    public void addControl(ExampleInputControl control, Screen screen, InputControlHandler.Output output) {
        EditBox box = new EditBox(...);
        box.setValue(String.valueOf(control.value()));

        // Add the elements to the output
        output.accept(
            // The element to render
            box,
            // The value output of the input
            Action.ValueGetter.of(box::getValue)
        );
    }
}

// Note that `register` is not public, so this needs to be access widened
InputControlHandlers.register(INPUT_CODEC, new ExampleInputControlHandler());
```

### Custom Actions

As shown above, an input can provide some value to pass to an `Action`. The former is known as a `$ValueGetter`, which essentially gets a stringified or tagged input to use. The latter, meanwhile, ends up creating the `ClickEvent` that is sent to the server. These are typically created through `ActionButton`s which defines some common button data along with the `Action` to perform.

A custom action contains two methods: one which returns the `MapCodec` (`codec`) to use during encoding, while the other creates the `ClickEvent` based on the map of input strings to their `$ValueGetter`s.

```java
public record ExampleAction() implements Action {
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleAction> ACTION_CODEC = MapCodec.unit(new ExampleAction());

    @Override
    public MapCodec<? extends Action> codec() {
        return ACTION_CODEC;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<ClickEvent> createAction(Map<String, Action.ValueGetter> keysToGetters) {
        // Handle how you want to map the key input map to some click event
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}

// Register the codec to the registry
Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.DIALOG_ACTION_TYPE, "examplemod:example_action", ExampleAction.ACTION_CODEC);
```

```json5
// For some dialog (assume `minecraft:notice`)
{
    "action": {
        // Button data
        "label": "Example!",
        "tooltip": "This is an example!",
        "width": 80,

        // The action to perform
        "action": {
            // Out action type
            "type": "examplemod:example_action"
        }
    }
}
```

Depending on how you implement your `Dialog` below, the action button will automatically be added to the screen, or you will need to add it in one of the methods via `DialogControlSet#createActionButton`:

```java
// For some DialogScreen implementation, we will assume some `SimpleDialog`
@Override
protected void updateHeaderAndFooter(HeaderAndFooterLayout layout, DialogControlSet controls, SimpleDialog dialog, DialogConnectionAccess access) {
    dialog.mainActions().forEach(actionButton -> layout.addToFooter(controls.createActionButton(actionButton).build()));
}
```

#### Custom Dialogs

A `Dialog` is pretty much all of the above components put together as desired. It is up to the user to choose how to implement them. Every `Dialog` must provide its `CommonDialogData`, which defines the basic title, body contents, and functionality. In additional, a `Dialog` may choose to execute an `Action` on close via `onCancel`.

```java
// `common` is already implemented by the record
public record ExampleDialog(CommonDialogData common, boolean val1, int val2) implements Dialog {
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleDialog> DIALOG_CODEC = RecordCodecBuilder.mapCodec(instance -> instance.group(
        CommonDialogData.MAP_CODEC.forGetter(ExampleDialog::common),
        Codec.BOOL.fieldOf("val1").forGetter(ExampleDialog::val1),
        Codec.INT.fieldOf("val2").forGetter(ExampleDialog::val2)
    ).apply(ExampleDialog::new));

    @Override
    public MapCodec<? extends Dialog> codec() {
        return DIALOG_CODEC;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<Action> onCancel() {
        // You can choose to return something here, or empty if nothing should be done
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}

// Register the codec to the registry
Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.DIALOG_TYPE, "examplemod:example_dialog", ExampleDialog.DIALOG_CODEC);
```

```json5
// For some dialog in `data/examplemod/dialog/example.json`
{
    // Our dialog type
    "type": "examplemod:example_dialog",
    
    // Common button data
    "title": "Example dialog!",
    "can_close_with_escape": true,
    "after_action": "wait_for_response",

    // Our custom params
    "val1": true,
    "val2": 0
}
```

Like the others, a dialog type can only be rendered through a `DialogScreen$Factory`. This interface constructs a `DialogScreen` given the parent `Screen`, `Dialog` instance, and `DialogConnectionAccess` used to communicate to the server. This dialog screen can then be linked to the `MapCodec` via `DialogScreens#register`.

```java
public class ExampleDialogScreen extends DialogScreen<ExampleDialog> {

    public ExampleDialogScreen(@Nullable Screen previousScreen, ExampleDialog dialog, DialogConnectionAccess connectionAccess) {
        super(previousScreen, dialog, connectionAccess);
    }

    // You can choose to implement the other methods as you wish
    // See existing dialog screens for an example

    @Override
    protected void populateBodyElements(LinearLayout layout, DialogControlSet controls, ExampleDialog dialog, DialogConnectionAccess access) {
        // Add elements and actions to the body of the screen (usually the center)
    }

    @Override
    protected void updateHeaderAndFooter(HeaderAndFooterLayout layout, DialogControlSet controls, ExampleDialog dialog, DialogConnectionAccess access) {
        // Add elements and actions to the header and footter of the screen (top and bottom)
    }
}

// Note that `register` is not public, so this needs to be access widened
DialogScreens.register(DIALOG_CODEC, ExampleDialogScreen::new);

## Waypoints

Waypoints are simply a method to track the position of some object in the game. The underlying system is handled by the `WaypointManager`, responsible for holding the waypoints it is tracking while also allowing updates and removals as necessary. The server handles waypoints through the `ServerWaypointManager` (obtained via `ServerLevel#getWaypointManager`), which holds an active connect to the transmitter to receive live updates. The client receives these waypoints via the `ClientWaypointManager` (obtained via `ClientPacketListener#getWaypointManager`), which simply holds some identifier along with an exact position, a chunk if the position is not within the view distance, or an angle if the distance is further than the stored `Waypoint$Fade#farDist`, which is over 332 blocks away by default.

Entities track waypoints by default.

### Styles and Icons

Every waypoint is represents by an icon of some kind, which is defined by its `WaypointStyle` and the color of the icon. A `WaypointStyle` is similar to a client item or a equipment model, where it has some key pointed to by a `WaypointStyleAsset` that's located in `assets/<modid>/waypoint_style/<path>.json`. This contains a list of sprites located within `assets/<modid>/textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot/<path>.png` which is chosen based upon the distance from the tracker. The sprites change between the range specified by the near and far distance.

```json5
// For some style examplemod:example_style
// It will be found in `assets/examplemod/waypoint_style/example_style.json`
{
    // Represents that any value closer will use the first sprite when rendering the bar
    // Defaults to 128 when not specified
    "near_distance": 100,
    // Represents that any value further will use the last sprite when rendering the bar
    // Defaults to 332 when not specified
    // Must be greater than near distance
    "far_distance": 400,
    // A non-empty list of textures relative to `assets/<modid>/textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot/<path>.png`
    // This is what's used to lerp between the two distances
    "sprites": [
        // Points to `assets/examplemod/textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot/example_style_0.png`
        "examplemod:example_style_0",
        "examplemod:example_style_1",
        "examplemod:example_style_2"
    ]
}
```

The icon can then be constructed using its constructor and referenced via `WaypointTransmitter#waypointIcon` or `TrackedWaypoint#icon` on the server or client, respectively.

```java
// We will assume that this constructor is made public for a more dynamic usage
// Currently, it can only be set on a `LivingEntity` through its `CompoundTag` via `locator_bar_icon`
public static Waypoint.Icon EXAMPLE_ICON = new Waypoint.Icon(
    // The registry key of the waypoint style
    // Points to `assets/examplemod/waypoint_style/example_style.json`
    ResourceKey.create(WaypointStyleAssets.ROOT_ID, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_style")),
    // The color of the waypoint
    // When not present, uses the hashcode of the waypoint identifier
    Optional.of(0xFFFFFF)
);
```

### Connections

Waypoints, when tracked, are managed through their connections via `WaypointTransmitter$Connection`. A connection is responsible for syncing information to the client, whether connecting, disconnecting, or updating.

```java
public class ExampleBlockConnection implements WaypointTransmitter.Connection {

    private final BlockState state;
    private final BlockPos pos;
    private final Waypoint.Icon icon;
    private final ServerPlayer receiver;

    public ExampleBlockConnection(BlockState state, BlockPos pos, Waypoint.Icon icon, ServerPlayer receiver) {
        this.state = state;
        this.pos = pos;
        this.icon = icon;
        this.recevier = receiver;
    }

    public static boolean doesSourceIgnoreReceiver(BlockPos pos, ServerPlayer player) {
        double receiveRange = player.getAttributeValue(Attributes.WAYPOINT_RECEIVE_RANGE);
        return pos.distSqr(player.blockPosition()) >= receiveRange * receiveRange;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isBroken() {
        // When true, it will attempt to remake the connection to this transmitter
        // This is only called when updating the position
        return ExampleBlockConnection.doesSourceIgnoreReceiver(this.pos, this.receiver);
    }

    @Override
    public void connect() {
        // This sends the tracking packet to the client
        this.receiver.connection.send(ClientboundTrackedWaypointPacket.addWaypointPosition(this.state.toString() + ": " + this.pos.toString(), this.icon, this.pos));
    }

    @Override
    public void disconnect() {
        // This sends the removal packet to the client
        this.receiver.connection.send(ClientboundTrackedWaypointPacket.removeWaypoint(this.state.toString() + ": " + this.pos.toString()));
    }

    @Override
    public void update() {
        // This updates the tracked value on the client assuming that the connect has not broken
        // In our case, we can assume this never changes as the position of a block should remain consistent
    }
}
```

### Transmitters

A `WaypointTransmitter` is responsible for constructing the connection between it and the server. For your object to transmit a location, it must implement `WaypointTransmitter` and its three methods. `waypointIcon` simply returns the icon to display. `isTransmittingWaypoint` will determine whether the waypoint can be transmitted from this object. `makeWaypointConnectionWith` actually handles constructing the connection used to track the position or angle of the connection.

```java
public class ExampleWaypointBlock extends BlockEntity implements WaypointTransmitter {

    // ...

    @Override
    public boolean isTransmittingWaypoint() {
        // This should return false if no connection should be made
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<WaypointTransmitter.Connection> makeWaypointConnectionWith(ServerPlayer player) {
        // Make a connection if nothing is ignored
        return ExampleBlockConnection.doesSourceIgnoreReceiver(this.getBlockPos(), player)
            ? Optional.empty()
            : Optional.of(new ExampleBlockConnection(this.getBlockState(), this.getBlockPos(), this.waypointIcon(), player));
    }

    @Override
    public Waypoint.Icon waypointIcon() {
        return EXAMPLE_ICON;
    }
}
```

Then, all you need to do is track, update, or untrack the transmitter as necessary. This can be done using the methods provided by `ServerWaypointManager`:

## Blaze3d Changes

Just like the previous update Blaze3d has new redesigns that change how rendering is handled.

### Buffer Slices

The most important change within the rendering system is the use of `GpuBufferSlice`s. As the name implies, it simply takes some slice of a `GpuBuffer`, using an `offset` to indicate the starting index, and the `length` to indicate its size. When dealing with anything rendering related, even when passing to a shader, you will almost always be dealing with a `GpuBufferSlice`. A way to think about it is that the buffer is just some arbitrary list of object where a slice represents a specific object.

To create a slice, simply call `GpuBuffer#slice`, optionally providing the starting index and length. In most instances, you will not be calling this method directly, instead dealing with other methods that call it for you. Note that as you are generally writing data to these slices, they should be constructed before a try-with-resources `RenderPass` is created.

### Uniform Rework

The uniform system has been completely overhauled such that, unless you are familiar with specific features, it might seem completely foreign. In a nutshell, uniforms are now stored as either interface objects, a texel buffer, or a sampler. These are populated either by `GpuBuffer`s or `GpuBufferSlice`s.

#### Uniform Types

A uniform is currently represented as one of two `UniformType`s: either as an `UNIFORM_BUFFER`/interface block, or a `TEXEL_BUFFER`. When setting up a pipeline and calling `withUniform`, you must specify your uniform with one of the above types. If you choose to use a texel buffer, you must also specify the format of the texture data. Samplers have not changed.

```java
public static final RenderPipeline EXAMPLE_PIPELINE = RenderPipeline.builder(...)
    // Uses a uniform interface block called 'ExampleUniform'
    .withUniform("ExampleUniform", UniformType.UNIFORM_BUFFER)
    // Uses a buffer called 'ExampleTexel' that stores texture data as a 8-bit R value
    .withUniform("ExampleTexel", UniformType.TEXEL_BUFFER, TextureFormat.RED8I)
    // Perform other setups
    .build();
```

#### Interface Blocks

A `UNIFORM_BUFFER` is stored as a `std140` interface block. In GLSL, this is represented like so:

```glsl
// In assets/examplemod/shaders/core/example_shader.json

// ExampleUniform is the name of the block
layout(std140) uniform ExampleUniform {
    // The data within the block
    // Post Effects can only use int, float, vec2, vec3, ivec3, vec4, or mat4
    vec4 Param1;
    float Param2;
};
```

The values can be used freely inside the main block like so:

```glsl
// In assets/examplemod/shaders/core/example_shader.json

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
    fragColor = Param1;
}
```

The uniform block can either be inside the same file as the main function or, if it will be reused, as a `moj_import`, where the uniform file is within `assets/<modid>/shaders/include/<path>`. Note that any shaders used before resource packs are loaded cannot use `moj_import`.

Post Effects define their interface blocks in the `uniform` input:

```json5
// In assets/examplemod/post_effect/example_post_effect.json
// Inside a 'passes' object
{
    "vertex_shader": "...",
    // ...
    "uniforms": {
        // The name of the interface block
        "ExampleUniform": [
            // A parameter within the uniform block
            // See `UniformValue` for codec formats
            {
                // The name of the parameter
                "name": "Param1",
                // The parameter type, one of:
                // - int
                // - ivec3
                // - float
                // - vec2
                // - vec3
                // - vec4
                // - matrix4x4 (mat4)
                "type": "vec4",
                // The value stored in the uniform
                // Dynamic values from the codebase are no longer supported
                "value": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Param2",
                "type": "float",
                "value": 0
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Texel Buffers

Texel buffers are typically represented as a `isamplerBuffer` to be queried from, typically using `texelFetch`:

```glsl
// In assets/examplemod/shaders/core/example_shader.json

uniform isamplerBuffer ExampleTexel;

void main() {
    // Read the documentation to understand how texel fetch works
    texelFetch(ExampleTexel, gl_InstanceID);
}
```

#### Writing Custom Uniforms

Writing custom uniforms can only happen when you are the one responsible for creating the `RenderPass`. Like before, you create and cache the object before opening the `RenderPass`, then you set the uniform by calling `RenderPass#withUniform`. The only difference is that, instead of providing arbitrary objects, you must now either provide a `GpuBuffer` or `GpuBufferSlice` with the uniform data written to it. For a texel buffer, this is usually some encoded data in the desired texture format (such as a mesh). For an interface block, the easiest method is to use the `Std140Builder` to populate the buffer with the correct values.

There are many different methods of writing to a `GpuBuffer` or `GpuBufferSlice`, such as using the newly created `MappableRingBuffer`. It is up to you to figure out what method works best in your scenario. The following is simply one solution out of many.

```java
// Buffer for 'ExampleUniform'
// Takes in the name of the buffer, its usage, and the size
private final MappableRingBuffer ubo = new MappableRingBuffer(
    // Buffer name
    () -> "Example UBO",
    // Buffer Usage
    // We set 128 as its used for a uniform and 2 since we are writing to it
    // Other bits can be found as constants in `GpuBuffer`
    GpuBuffer.USAGE_UNIFORM | GpuBuffer.USAGE_MAP_WRITE,
    // The size of the buffer
    // Easiest method is to use Std140SizeCalculator to properly calculate this
    new Std140SizeCalculator()
        // Param1
        .putVec4()
        // Param2
        .putFloat()
        .get()
);

// Buffer for 'ExampleTexel'
private final MappableRingBuffer utb = new MappableRingBuffer(
    // Buffer name
    () -> "Example UTB",
    // We set 256 as its used for a texel buffer and 2 since we are writing to it
    GpuBuffer.USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER | GpuBuffer.USAGE_MAP_WRITE,
    // The size of the buffer
    // It will likely be larger than this for you
    3
);

// In some render method

// Populate the buffers as required

// As we are using a ring buffer, this simply uses the next available buffer in the list
this.ubo.rotate();
// Write the data to the buffer
try (GpuBuffer.MappedView view = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().mapBuffer(this.ubo.currentBuffer(), false, true)) {
    Std140Builder.intoBuffer(view.data())
        .putVec4(0f, 0f, 0f, 0f)
        .putFloat(0f);
}

// Similar thing here
this.utb.rotate();
try (GpuBuffer.MappedView view = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().mapBuffer(this.utb.currentBuffer(), false, true)) {
    view.data()
        .put((byte) 0)
        .put((byte) 0)
        .put((byte) 0);
}

// Create the render pass and pass in the buffers as part of the uniform
try (RenderPass pass = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().createRenderPass(...)) {
    // ..
    pass.setUniform("ExampleUniform", this.ubo.currentBuffer());
    pass.setUniform("ExampleTexel", this.utb.currentBuffer());
    // ...
}
```

### Fog Environments

The fog system has been reworked into an environment/render state-like handler. Each environment mostly handles setting up the fog data and color. Some additional processing is provided for the individual `FogType`s and special mob effects.

All environments are handled through the `FogEnvironment`. A environment is setup via the `setupFog` method, which is repsonsible for mutating the passed in `FogData` to the values associated with that environment. If the fog colors its surroundings, then `providesColor` should return true, with the base color tint applied in `getBaseColor`. Likewise, if the fog darkens its surroundings, then `modifiesDarkness` should return true, with the modified darkness returned via `getModifiedDarkness`. To determine whether an environment should apply, `isApplicable` is checked. If not applicable, then `onNotApplicable` is called.

All environments are registered to `FogRenderer#FOG_ENVIRONMENTS`; however, what environment to use is based on `isApplicable` and the list order. For the color and darkness, the fog environment chosen is the last one in the list where one of the `provides*` methods return true. For the actual fog setup, the fog environment chosen is the first one in the list.

### Render Pass Scissoring now only OpenGL

The scissoring state has been removed from the generic pipeline code, now only accessible through the OpenGL implementation. Generic region handling has been delegated to `CommandEncoder#clearColorAndDepthTextures`.

## Tag Providers: Appender Rewrite

The `TagAppender` has been rewritten to a degree, changing the basic implementations of `TagsProvider`s.

By default, the `TagsProvider` no longer provides any useful methods for adding content to a `TagBuilder`. The most you can do is construct the builder using `TagsProvider#getOrCreateRawBuilder` and add elements or tags via their `ResourceLocation` using one of the available `add*` methods.

```java
// We will assume there is some TagKey<Item> EXAMPLE_TAG
public class ExampleTagsProvider extends TagsProvider<Item> {

    public ExampleTagsProvider(PackOutput output, CompletableFuture<HolderLookup.Provider> registries, CompletableFuture<TagsProvider.TagLookup<Item>> parentProvider) {
        super(
            // The output location of the pack
            output,
            // The registry key to generate tags for
            Registries.ITEM,
            // The registry of registries
            registries,
            // Optional: A parent provider to use the generate tags of
            // Typically obtained from TagsProvider#contentsGetter
            parentProvider
        );
    }

    @Override
    protected void addTags(HolderLookup.Provider registries) {
        // Add tags here
        TagBuilder builder = this.getOrCreateRawBuilder(EXAMPLE_TAG);
        builder
            // Add single element
            .addElement(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("minecraft", "apple"))
            // Add tag to builder
            .addTag(ItemTags.WOOL.location());
    }
}
```

But what if we want to reference tags by their `ResourceKey`? Or registry object? This is where the rewritten `TagAppender` comes in. `TagAppender` is an interface with two generics, `E` which represents the type of the entry to add, and `T` which represents the type of the objects within the tag. A `TagAppender` has five common methods: three that add entries (`add`, `addAll`, `addOptional`), and two that add tags  (`addTag`, `addOptionalTag`). A `TagAppender` can be created via `forBuilder`, which accepts `ResourceKey`s for entries.

`KeyTagProvider` provides this for you by adding a `tag` method, creating the appender from a `TagKey`. Generally, datapack registry objects have their tags generated using this provider:

```java
// We will assume there is some TagKey<Item> EXAMPLE_TAG
public class ExampleTagsProvider extends KeyTagProvider<Item> {

    public ExampleTagsProvider(PackOutput output, CompletableFuture<HolderLookup.Provider> registries) {
        super(
            // The output location of the pack
            output,
            // The registry key to generate tags for
            Registries.ITEM,
            // The registry of registries
            registries
        );
    }

    @Override
    protected void addTags(HolderLookup.Provider registries) {
        // Add tags here
        TagAppender<ResourceKey<Item>, Item> builder = this.tag(EXAMPLE_TAG);
        builder
            // Add single element
            .add(ResourceKey.create(Registries.ITEM, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("minecraft", "apple")))
            // Add tag to builder
            .addTag(ItemTags.WOOL);
    }
}
```

`TagAppender`s can also be mapped to change their entry type using the `map` method. This takes in a function which maps the new entry type to the original entry type. `IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider` provides this for you via a `tag` method, creating the appender from a `TagKey` and mapping it using a key extractor. Generally, built-in registry objects have their tags generated using this provider:

```java
// We will assume there is some TagKey<Item> EXAMPLE_TAG
public class ExampleTagsProvider extends IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider<Item> {

    public ExampleTagsProvider(PackOutput output, CompletableFuture<HolderLookup.Provider> registries) {
        super(
            // The output location of the pack
            output,
            // The registry key to generate tags for
            Registries.ITEM,
            // The registry of registries
            registries,
            // Maps the registry object to its resource key
            item -> item.builtInRegistryHolder().key()
        );
    }

    @Override
    protected void addTags(HolderLookup.Provider registries) {
        // Add tags here
        TagAppender<Item, Item> builder = this.tag(EXAMPLE_TAG);
        builder
            // Add single element
            .add(Items.APPLE)
            // Add tag to builder
            .addTag(ItemTags.WOOL);
    }
}
```

### Copying Tags: Block and Item

Copying tags no longer exists in the traditional sense, where it loops through the elements of an existing tag. Insteadd, the implementation has been narrowed down to a general `BlockItemTagsProvider`. This method provides a `TagAppender<Block, Block>` by taking in both a block and an item tag, and then converting them appropriately within the `Vanilla*TagsProvider`. As such, it is less copying and more mapping blocks to their associated items.

The one drawback is that tags that are used within other tags (calling `addTag`) must have the same name. For example, adding `BlockTags#LOGS` only works because there is a `minecraft:logs` for both block and item tags. Meanwhile, adding `BlockTags#CEILING_HANGING_SIGNS` would fail as the associated item tag is `minecraft:hanging_signs` instead of `minecraft:ceiling_hanging_signs`.

```java
// We will assume there is some TagKey<Block> BLOCK_EXAMPLE_TAG
// We will assume there is some TagKey<Item> ITEM_EXAMPLE_TAG
public class ExampleBlockItemTagsProvider extends BlockItemTagsProvider {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Add block item tags here
        // Will add entries to block or item tag depending on the provider
        TagAppender<Block, Block> builder = this.tag(BLOCK_EXAMPLE_TAG, ITEM_EXAMPLE_TAG);
        builder
            // Add single element
            .add(Blocks.TERRACOTTA)
            // Add tag to builder
            // There exists both `minecraft:logs` in block and item tags
            .addTag(BlockTags.LOGS);
    }
}

// For some IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider<Item> or IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider<Block>
@Override
protected void addTags(HolderLookup.Provider registries) {
    // Add tags here
    new ExampleBlockItemTagsProvider() {
        // Or <Item, Item> depending on the situation
        protected TagAppender<Block, Block> tag(TagKey<Block> blockTag, TagKey<Item> itemTag) {
            // Return a TagAppender
            // See VanillaItemTagsProvider$BlockToItemConverter for an item example
            // See VanillaBlockTagsProvider for a block example
        }
    }.run();
}
```

    - `BlockItemTagsProvider` - A provider that generates tags for block items, using the block and item tag equivalents as a starting point.
    - `IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider`
        - `tag` now returns the raw `TagAppender`

    - `ItemTagsProvider` class is removed
    - `KeyTagProvider` - A provider which appends elements via their `ResourceKey`.
    - `TagsProvider`
        - `tag` is removed

    - `VanillaItemTagsProvider` now implements `IntrinsicHolderTagsProvider`
        - `BlockToItemConverter` - A tag appender that adds a block to an item tag.

## Generic Encoding and Decoding: Replacing Direct NBT Access

Direct access to get data out of some NBT has been removed completely from higher level objects like entities and block entities. This means that, generally, you cannot directly touch the `CompoundTag` during the serialization process. Instead, indirect access is provided to nbt tags via `ValueInput` and `ValueOutput`. As their name implies, these read values from and write values to the data object, respectively. The methods available are similar to those on `CompoundTag`s. For `ValueInput`, there's the `get*` methods by providing the associated key, and `get*Or` for a get-or-default if not present. There is also `read` for handling `Codec`s. For `ValueOutput`, there's the `put*` methods by providing the associated key and value, and also a `store` for `Codec`s. List variants exists separately on the input/output access.

As such, most methods that take in a `CompoundTag` now instead take in a `ValueInput` for `read`/`load` or `ValueOutput` for `write`/`save`.

```java
// For some Entity with an ItemStack stack
@Override
protected void readAdditionalSaveData(ValueInput in) {
    super.readAdditionalSaveData(in);
    // By default, the input uses a registry ops
    this.stack = in.read("example_stack", ItemStack.CODEC).orElse(ItemStack.EMPTY);
}

@Override
protected void addAdditionalSaveData(ValueOutput out) {
    super.addAdditionalSaveData(out);
    // By default, the output uses a registry ops
    in.storeNullable("example_stack", ItemStack.CODEC, this.stack);
}

// For some BlockEntity with an int value
@Override
    protected void loadAdditional(ValueInput in) {
        super.loadAdditional(in);
        this.value = in.getIntOr("value", 0);
    }

    @Override
    protected void saveAdditional(ValueOutput out) {
        super.saveAdditional(out);
        out.putInt("value", this.value);
    }
```

### NBT Implementations

To provide indirect access to `CompoundTag`s, there are implementations of `ValueInput` and `ValueOutput` called `TagValueInput` and `TagValueOutput` respectively.

A `TagValueOutput` can be created using either `createWithContext` or `createWithoutContext`. 'With context' means that the output has access to the `HolderLookup$Provider` for registry objects while 'without context' does not. Currently, no location uses `createWithoutContext`. Internally, this creates a new `CompoundTag`. Then, this output is passed around to be populated before finally returning the NBT for writing via `buildResult`.

A `TagValueInput`, on the other hand, can be created via `create`, taking in the `HolderLookup$Provider` and the `CompoundTag` to read from. If the data is stored as a list of objects rather than a single object, you can pass in a `List<CompoundTag>` and get back a `ValueInputList`. Note this does not handle indicies, only providing an iterable or stream associated implementation.

### Problem Reporter

In addition to what's mentioned above, the `create*` methods also take in a `ProblemReporter`, used for collecting all problems encountered when attempting to serialize/deserialize the data. It is up to the implementation to determine whether this report causes a crash or gives a warning. A `ProblemReporter` contains two methods: `report`, which reports a `$Problem`; and `forChild`, which further groups `$Problem`s using a `$PathElement`. Both problems and path elements are simply interface objects that return a string indicating what the problem is or the grouping, respectively.

There are two common `ProblemReporter`s that are used: `$Collector`, which is typically used with data providers, and `$ScopedCollector`, which is used with disk objects (e.g., entities, block entities, chunks, etc.). A `$Collector` typiccally uses either `forEach` to report each problem one by one, `getReport`/`getTreeReport` to return a stringified problems, or `isEmpty` to list if there are any problems. A `$ScopedCollector` does the same, except this is `AutoCloseable`, in case nothing is done with the output. In these scenarios, the reports are written to a logger.

Each collector takes in an initial `$PathElement`. This typically comes from the object itself containing some method called `problemPath`, which implements the interface. The `HolderLookup$Provider` is provided in the same fashion.

```java
// For some object with HolderLookup.Provider registries
// There is also a Logger LOGGER

// Let's assume our root path element is implemented like so
public record ExamplePathElement(String name) implements ProblemReporter.PathElement {

    @Override
    public String get() {
        return "Example: " + this.name();
    }
}

// For a data provider
ProblemReporter.Collector problems = new ProblemReporter.Collector(
    // Can be empty for a non-specified root
    new ExamplePathElement("data_provider")
);
// Pass around the provider

// For a disk-based object
try (ProblemReporter.ScopedCollector problems = new ProblemReporter.ScopedCollector(new ExamplePathElement("EXAMPLE TEST"), LOGGER)) {
    TagValueOutput out = TagValueOutput.createWithContext(problems, this.registries);
    // Pass around the output to write data

    // For the input
    // The last parameter can be whatever CompoundTag, using the output as an example
    TagValueInput in = TagValueInput.create(problems, this.registries, out.buildResult());
    // Pass around the input to read data
}

This provides the previously provided `hasPermission` method, in addition to a new method `allowsSelectors`, which returns whether the source has the necessary permission to select other entities (defaults to level 2 perms). You can incoporate the permission check into your commands by calling `Commands#hasPermission` with the desired level in `ArgumentBuilder#requires`.

- `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer`
    - `ClientPacketListener`
        - `getCommands` now returns a `ClientSuggestionProvider` generic
        - `sendUnattendedCommand` now takes in a `Screen` instead of a `boolean`
    - `ClientSuggestionListener` now implements `PermissionSource`, taking in a boolean of whether it allows restricted commands
        - `allowRestrictedCommands` - Returns whether restricted commands can be suggested.
- `net.minecraft.commands`
    - `Commands#hasPermission` - Returns a permission check for the given level.
    - `CommandSourceStack` now implements `PermissionSource`
    - `ExecutionCommandSource` now implements `PermissionSource`
    - `PermissionSource` - Returns the source of the permission to run a command.
    - `SharedSuggestionProvider`
        - `suggestResgitryElements` now takes in a `HolderLookup` instead of a `Registry`
        - `listSuggestions` - Lists the suggestion for some registry elements.
        - `hasPermission` is removed
- `net.minecraft.commands.synchronization.SuggestionProviders`
    - `AVAILABLE_SOUNDS`, `SUMMONABLE_ENTITIES` now take in a `SharedSuggestionProvider` for their generic
    - `cast` - Casts the suggestion provider to the correct type.
    - `safelySwap` is removed
    - `$Wrapper` -> `$RegisteredSuggestion`
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity#getCommandSenderWorld` is removed

### Animation Baking

Animations are now baked into `KeyframeAnimation`. Each `KeyframeAnimation` is made up of entries that apply the keyframes to a given `ModelPart`. To create an animation, the definition should be baked via `AnimationDefinition#bake` in the model constructor, then calling `#apply` or `#applyWalk` as required during `EntityModel#setupAnim`.

```java
// For some entity model
// Assume some AnimationDefinition EXAMPLE_DEFN
// Assume our ExampleEntityState has some AnimationState exampleAnimState
public class ExampleModel extends EntityModel<ExampleEntityState> {

    private final KeyframeAnimation exampleAnim;

    public ExampleModel(ModelPart root) {
        // We pass in whatever 'root' that can apply all animations
        this.exampleAnim = EXAMPLE_DEFN.bake(root);
    }

    @Override
    public void setupAnim(ExampleEntityState state) {
        super.setupAnim(state);
        this.exampleAnim.apply(state.exampleAnimState, state.ageInTicks);
    }
}
```

- `net.minecraft.client.animation`
    - `AnimationDefinition#bake` - Bakes a defined animation to be used on a `Model`.
    - `KeyframeAnimation` - A baked animation used to move `ModelPart`s on a given `Model`.
    - `KeyframeAnimations#animate` -> `KeyframeAnimation$Entry#apply`
- `net.minecraft.client.model.Model`
    - `getAnyDescendantWithName` is removed
    - `animate` -> `KeyframeAnimation#apply`
    - `animateWalk` - `KeyframeAnimation#applyWalk`
    - `applyStatic` -> `KeyframeAnimation#applyStatic`
- `net.minecraft.client.model.geom.ModelPart`
    - `getAllParts` now returns a `List`
    - `createPartLookup` - Creates a lookup of part names to their `ModelPart`, any duplicate names are ignored.

### ChunkSectionLayers

`RenderType`s used for defining how a block or fluid should render are now replaced with `ChunkSectionLayer`s. These functionally do the same thing as the `RenderType`; however, they only specify the `RenderPipeline` to use along with the buffer information. This also means that certain `RenderType`s are removed, like `TRANSLUCENT`, as they were only used for the block chunk rendering.

This also means that adding to `ItemBlockRenderTypes#TYPE_BY_BLOCK` must specify the `ChunkSectionLayer` instead of the associated `RenderType`.
