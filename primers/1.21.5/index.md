## Pack Changes

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=1.21.5&tab=changelog).

## Handling the Removal of Block Entities Properly

Previously, `BlockEntity` would handle all of their removal logic within `BlockBehaviour#onRemove`, including both dropping any stored items and removing the block entity itself. However, depending on how the method is used, it can cause some strange behaviors due to the mutable state of the block entity. For this reason, the logic that makes up the removal process has been split between two methods: `BlockEntity#preRemoveSideEffects` and `BlockBehaviour#affectNeighborsAfterRemoval`.

`BlockEntity#preRemoveSideEffects` is now responsible for removing anything from the block entity before it is removed from the level. By default, if the `BlockEntity` is a `Container` instance, it will drop the contents of the container into the level. Other logic can be handled within here, but it should generally avoid removing the `BlockEntity` itself, unless the position of the block entity tends to change dynamically, like for a piston.

From there, the `LevelChunk` logic will call `removeBlockEntity` before calling `BlockBehaviour#affectNeighborsAfterRemoval`. This should only send the updates to other blocks indicating that this block has been removed from the level. For `BlockEntity` holders, this can be done easily by calling `Containers#updateNeighboursAfterDestroy`. Otherwise may want to call `Level#updateNeighborsAt` themselves, depending on the situation.

- `net.minecraft.world.Containers`
    - `updateNeighboursAfterDestroy` - Updates the neighbor state aftering destroying the block at the specified position.
    - `dropContentsOnDestroy` is removed, handled within `BlockEntity#preRemoveSideEffects` for `Container` instances
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.BlockEntity#preRemoveSideEffects` - Handles logic on the block entity that should happen before being removed from the level.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour#onRemove`, `$BlockStateBase#onRemove` -> `affectNeighborsAfterRemoval`, should only handle logic to update the surrounding neighbors rather than dropping container data

## Voxel Shape Helpers

`VoxelShape`s have received numerous helpers for more common transformations of its base state. There are the `Block` methods for creating a centered (if desired) box and the `Shapes` methods for rotating a `VoxelShape` to its appropriate axis or direction. There is also a `Shapes#rotateAttachFace` method for rotating some `VoxelShape` that is attached to a face of a different block. The results are either stored in a `Map` of some key to a `VoxelShape`, or when using `Block#getShapeForEachState`, a `Function<BlockState, VoxelShape>`.

Most of the `Block` subclasses that had previous public or protected `VoxelShape`s are now private, renamed to a field typically called `SHAPE` or `SHAPES`. Stored `VoxelShape`s may also be in a `Function` instead of directly storing the map itself.

- `com.mojang.math.OctahedralGroup`
    - `permute` - Returns the axis that the given axis is permuted to within the specified group.
    - `fromAngles` - Creates a group with the provided X and Y rotations.
- `net.minecraft.core.Direction$Axis#choose` now has an overload that takes in three booleans
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.Block`
    - `boxes` - Creates one more than the specified number of boxes, using the index as part of the function to create the `VoxelShape`s.
    - `cube` - Creates a centered cube of the specified size.
    - `column` - Creates a horizontally centered column of the specified size.
    - `boxZ` - Creates a vertically centered (around the X axis) cube/column of the specified size.
    - `getShapeForEachState` now returns a `Function` which wraps the `ImmutableMap`, there is also a method that only considers the specified properties instead of all possible states.
- `net.minecraft.world.phys.shapes`
    - `DiscreteVoxelShape#rotate` - Rotates a voxel shape according to the permutation of the `OctahedralGroup`.
    - `Shapes`
        - `blockOccudes` -> `blockOccludes`
        - `rotate` - Rotates a given voxel shape according to the permutation of the `OctahedralGroup` around the provided vector, or block center if not specified.
        - `equal` - Checks if two voxel shapes are equivalent.
        - `rotateHorizontalAxis` - Creates a map of axes to `VoxelShape`s of a block being rotated around the y axis.
        - `rotateAllAxis` - Creates a map of axes to `VoxelShape`s of a block being rotated around any axis.
        - `rotateHorizontal` - Creates a map of directions to `VoxelShape`s of a block being rotated around the y axis.
        - `rotateAll` - Creates a map of directions to `VoxelShape`s of a block being rotated around the any axis.
        - `rotateAttachFace` - Creates a map of faces to a map of directions to `VoxelShape`s of a block being rotated around the y axis when attaching to the faces of other blocks.
    - `VoxelShape#move` now has an overload to take in a `Vec3i`

## Weapons, Tools, and Armor: Removing the Redundancies

There have been a lot of updates to weapons, tools, and armor that removes the reliance on the hardcoded base classes of `SwordItem`, `DiggerItem`, and `ArmorItem`, respectively. These have been replaced with their associated data components `WEAPON` for damage, `TOOL` for mining, `ARMOR` for protection, and `BLOCKS_ATTACKS` for shields. Additionally, the missing attributes are usually specified by setting the `ATTRIBUTE_MODIFIERS`, `MAX_DAMAGE`, `MAX_STACK_SIZE`, `DAMAGE`, `REPAIRABLE`, and `ENCHANTABLE`. Given that pretty much all of the non-specific logic has moved to a data component, these classes have now been completely removed. Use one of the available item property methods or call `Item$Properties#component` directly to set up each item as a weapon, tool, armor, or some combination of the three.

Constructing a `BlockAttacks` component for a shield-like item:

```java
var blocker = new BlocksAttacks(
    // The number of seconds to wait when the item is being used
    // before the blocking effect is applied.
    1.2f,
    // A scalar to change how many ticks the blocker is disabled
    // for. If negative, the blocker cannot normally be disabled.
    0.5f,
    // A list of reductions for what type and how much of a damage type
    // is blocked by this blocker.
    List.of(
        new DamageReduction(
            // The horizontal blocking angle of the shield required to apply
            // the reduction
            90f,
            // A set of damage types this reduction should apply for.
            // When empty, it applies for all damage types.
            Optional.empty(),
            // The base damage to reduce the attack by.
            1f,
            // A scalar representing the fraction of the damage blocked.
            0.5f
        )
    ),
    // A function that determines how much durability to remove to the blocker.
    new ItemDamageFunction(
        // A threshold that specifies the minimum amount of damage required
        // to remove durability from the blocker.
        4f,
        // The base durability to remove from the blocker.
        1f,
        // A scalar representing the fraction of the damage to convert into
        // removed durability.
        0.5f
    ),
    // A tag key containing the items that can bypass the blocker and deal
    // damage directly to the wielding entity. If empty, no item can bypass
    // the blocker.
    Optional.of(DamageTypeTags.BYPASSES_SHIELD),
    // The sound to play when the blocker successfully mitigates some damage.
    Optional.of(SoundEvents.SHIELD_BLOCK),
    // The sound to play when the blocker is disabled by a weapon.
    Optional.of(SoundEvents.SHIELD_BREAK)
);
```

Constructing a `Weapon` component for a sword-like item:

```java
var weapon = new Weapon(
    // The amount of durability to remove from the item.
    3,
    // The number of seconds a `BlocksAttack`s component item should
    // be disabled for when hit with this weapon.
    5f
);

### Extrapolating the Saddles: Equipment Changes

A new `EquipmentSlot` has been added for saddles, which brings with it new changes for genercizing slot logic.

First, rendering an equipment slot for an entity can now be handled as an additional `RenderLayer` called `SimpleEquipmentLayer`. This takes in the entity renderer, the `EquipmentLayerRenderer`, the layer type to render, a function to get the `ItemStack` from the entity state, and the adult and baby models. The renderer will attempt to look up the client info from the associated equippable data component and use that to render the laters as necessary.

Next, instead of having individual lists for each equipment slot on the entity, there is now a general `EntityEquipment` object that holds a delegate to a map of slots to `ItemStack`s. This simplifies the storage logic greatly.

Finally, equippables can now specify whether wearing one will contribute to the bonus XP earned when killing a mob by setting `equipOnInteract`.

## Weighted List Rework

The weighted random lists have been redesigned into a basic class that hold weighted entries, and a helper class that can obtain weights from the objects themselves.

First there is `WeightedList`. It is effectively the replacement for `SimpleWeightedRandomList`, working the exact same way by storing `Weighted` (replacement for `WeightedEntry`) entries in the list itself. Internally, the list is either stored as a flat array of object entries, or the compact weighted list if the total weight is greater than 64. Then, to get a random element, either `getRandom` or `getRandomOrThrow` can be called to obtain an entry. Both of these methods will either return some form of an empty object or exception if there are no elements in the list.

Then there are the static helpers within `WeightedRandom`. These take in raw lists and some `ToIntFunction` that gets the weight from the list's object. Some methods also take in an integer either representing the largest index to choose from or the entry associated with the weighted index.

- `net.minecraft.client.resources.model.WeightedBakedModel` now takes in a `WeightedList` instead of a `SimpleWeightedRandomList`
- `net.minecraft.util.random`
    - `SimpleWeightedRandomList`, `WeightedRandomList` -> `WeightedList`, now final and not one-to-one
        - `contains` - Checks if the list contains this element.
    - `Weight` class is removed
    - `WeightedEntry` -> `Weighted`
    - All `WeightedRandom` static methods now take in a `ToIntFunction` to get the weight of some entry within the provided list
- `net.minecraft.util.valueproviders.WeightedListInt` now takes in a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.SpawnData#LIST_CODEC` is now a `WeightedList` of `SpawnData`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.biome`
    - `Biome#getBackgroundMusic` is now a `WeightedList` of `Music`
    - `BiomeSpecialEffects#getBackgroundMusic`, `$Builder#backgroundMusic` is now a `WeightedList` of `Music`
    - `MobSpawnSettings#EMPTY_MOB_LIST`, `getMobs` is now a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.trialspawner.TrialSpawnerConfig#spawnPotentialsDefinition`, `lootTablesToEject` now takes in a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.chunk.ChunkGenerator#getMobsAt` now returns a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.feature.stateproviders.WeightedStateProvider` now works with `WeightedList`s
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.heightproviders.WeightedListHeight` now works with `WeightedList`s
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.structure.StructureSpawnOverride` now takes in a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.structure.pools.alias`
    - `PoolAliasBinding#random`, `randomGroup` now takes in a `WeightedList`
    - `Random` now takes in a `WeightedList`
    - `RandomGroup` now takes in a `WeightedList`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.structure.structures.NetherFortressStructure#FORTRESS_ENEMIES` is now a `WeightedList`

## Tickets

Tickets have been reimplemented into a half type registry-like, half hardcoded system. The underlying logic of keeping a chunk loaded or simulated for a certain period of time still exists; however, the logic associated with each ticket is hardcoded into their appropriate locations, such as the forced or player loading tickets.

Tickets begin with their registered `TicketType`, which contains information about how many ticks should the ticket should last for (or `0` when permanent), whether the ticket should be saved to disk, and what the ticket is used for. A ticket has two potential uses: one for loading the chunk and keeping it loaded, and one for simulating the chunk based on the expected movement of the ticket creator. Most ticks specify that they are for both loading and simulation.

There are two special types that have additional behavior associated with them. `TicketType#FORCED` has some logic for immediately loading the chunk and keeping it loaded. `TicketType#UNKNOWN` cannot be automatically timed out, meaning they are never removed unless explicitly specified.

```java
// You need to register the ticket type to `BuiltInRegistries#TICKET_TYPE`
public static final TicketType EXAMPLE = new TicketType(
    // The amount of ticks before the ticket is removed
    // Set to 0 if it should not be removed
    0L,
    // Whether the ticket should be saved to disk
    true,
    // What the ticket will be used for
    TicketType.TicketUse.LOADING_AND_SIMULATION
);
```

Then there is the `Ticket` class, which are actually stored and handled within the `TicketStorage`. The `Ticket` class takes in the type of the ticket and uses it to automatically populate how long until it expires. It also takes in the ticket level, which is a generally a value of 31 (for entity ticking and block ticking), 32 (for block ticking), or 33 (only can access static or modify, not naturally update) minus the radius of chunks that can be loaded. A ticket is then added to the process by calling `TicketStorage#addTicketWithRadius` or its delegate `ServerChunkCache#addTicketWithRadius`. There is also `addTicket` if you wish to specify the ticket manually rather than having it computed based on its radius.

        - `getChunkLevel` - Returns the current chunk level or the simulated level when the provided boolean is true.

        - `removeRegionTicket` -> `removeTicketWithRadius`
        - `removeTicketsOnClosing` -> `deactivateTicketsOnClosing`
    - `Ticket` is no longer final or implements `Comparable`
        - The constructor no longer takes in a key
        - `CODEC`

    - `TicketType` is now a record and no longer has a generic
        - `getComparator` is removed
        - `doesLoad`, `doesSimulate` - Checks whether the ticket use is for their particular instance.
        - `$TicketUse` - What a ticket can be used for.
    - `TickingTracker` -> `SimulationChunkTracker`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.ForcedChunksSavedData` -> `TicketStorage`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.chunk.ChunkSource`
    - `updateChunkForced` now returns a boolean indicating if the chunk has been forcefully loaded
    - `getForceLoadedChunks` - Returns all chunks that have been forcefully loaded.

## The Game Test Overhaul

Game tests have been completely overhauled into a registry based system, completely revamped from the previous automatic annotation-driven system. However, most implementations required to use the system must be implemented yourself rather than provided by vanilla. As such, this explanation will go over the entire system, including which parts need substantial work to use it similarly to the annotation-driven system of the previous version.

### The Environment

All game tests happen within some environment. Most of the time, a test can occur independent of the area, but sometimes, the environment needs to be curated in some fashion, such as checking whether an entity or block does something at a given time or whether. To facilitate the setup and teardown of the environment for a given test instance, a `TestEnvironmentDefinition` is created.

A `TestEnvironmentDefinition` works similarly to the `BeforeBatch` and `AfterBatch` annotations. The environment contains two methods `setup` and `teardown` that manage the `ServerLevel` for the test. The environments are structured in a type-based registry system, meaning that every environment registers a `MapCodec` to built-in registry `minecraft:test_environment_definition_type` that is then consumed via the `TestEnvironmentDefinition` in a datapack registry `minecraft:test_environment`.

Vanilla, by default, provides the `minecraft:default` test environment which does not do anything. However, additional test environments can be created using the available test definition types.

#### Game Rules

This environment type sets the game rules to use for the test. During teardown, the game rules are set back to their default value.

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:game_rules",

    // A list of game rules with boolean values to set
    "bool_rules": [
        {
            // The name of the rule
            "rule": "doFireTick",
            "value": false
        }
        // ...
    ],

    // A list of game rules with integer values to set
    "int_rules": [
        {
            "rule": "playersSleepingPercentage",
            "value": 50
        }
        // ...
    ]
}
```

#### Time of Day

This environment type sets the time to some non-negative integer, similar to how the `/time set <number>` command is used.

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:time_of_day",

    // Sets the time of day in the world
    // Common values:
    // - Day      -> 1000
    // - Noon     -> 6000
    // - Night    -> 13000
    // - Midnight -> 18000
    "time": 13000
}
```

#### Weather

This environment type sets the weather, similar to how the `/weather` command is used.

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:weather",

    // Can be one of three values:
    // - clear   (No weather)
    // - rain    (Rain)
    // - thunder (Rain and thunder)
    "weather": "thunder"
}
```

#### Function

This environment type provides two `ResourceLocation`s to mcfunctions to setup and teardown the level, respectively.

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:function",

    // The setup mcfunction to use
    // If not specified, nothing will be ran
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/function/example/setup.mcfunction'
    "setup": "examplemod:example/setup",

    // The teardown mcfunction to use
    // If not specified, nothing will be ran
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/function/example/teardown.mcfunction'
    "teardown": "examplemod:example/teardown"
}
```

#### Composite

If multiple combinations are required, then the composite environment type (aptly named `all_of`) can be used to string multiple of the above environment types together.

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:all_of",

    // A list of test environments to use
    // Can either specified the registry name or the environment itself
    "definitions": [
        // Points to 'data/minecraft/test_environment/default.json'
        "minecraft:default",
        {
            // A raw environment definition
            "type": "..."
        }
        // ...
    ]
}
```

### Custom Types

If none of the types above work, then a custom definition can be created by implementing `TestEnvironmentDefinition` and creating an associated `MapCodec`:

```java
public record ExampleEnvironmentType(int value1, boolean value2) implements TestEnvironmentDefinition {

    // Construct the map codec to register
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleEnvironmentType> CODEC = RecordCodecBuilder.mapCodec(instance -> instance.group(
            Codec.INT.fieldOf("value1").forGetter(ExampleEnvironmentType::value1),
            Codec.BOOL.fieldOf("value2").forGetter(ExampleEnvironmentType::value2)
        ).apply(instance, ExampleEnvironmentType::new)
    );

    @Override
    public void setup(ServerLevel level) {
        // Setup whatever is necessary here
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown(ServerLevel level) {
        // Undo whatever was changed within the setup method
        // This should either return to default or the previous value
    }

    @Override
    public MapCodec<ExampleEnvironmentType> codec() {
        return CODEC;
    }
}
```

Then register the `MapCodec` using whatever registry method is required by your mod loader:

```java
Registry.register(
    BuiltInRegistries.TEST_ENVIRONMENT_DEFINITION_TYPE,
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_environment_type"),
    ExampleEnvironmentType.CODEC
);
```

Finally, you can use it in your environment definition:

```json5
// examplemod:example_environment
// In 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
{
    "type": "examplemod:example_environment_type",

    "value1": 0,
    "value2": true
}
```

### Test Functions

The initial concept of game tests were structured around running functions from `GameTestHelper` determining whether the test succeeds or fails. Test functions are the registry-driven representation of those. Essentially, every test function is a method that takes in a `GameTestHelper`.

At the moment, vanilla only provides `minecraft:always_pass`, which just calls `GameTestHelper#succeed`. Test functions are also not generated, meaning it simply runs the value with whatever is provided. As such, a test function should generally represent a single old game test:

```java
Registry.register(
    BuiltInRegistries.TEST_FUNCTION,
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_function"),
    (GameTestHelper helper) -> {
        // Run whatever game test commands you want
        helper.assertBlockPresent(...);

        // Make sure you have some way to succeed
        helper.succeedIf(() -> ...);
    }
);
```

### Test Data

Now that we have environments and test functions, we can get into defining our game test. This is done through `TestData`, which is the equivalent of the `GameTest` annotation. The only things changed are that structures are now referenced by their `ResourceLocation` via `structure`, `GameTest#timeoutTicks` is now renamed to `TestData#maxTicks`, and instead of specifying `GameTest#rotationSteps`, you simply provide the `Rotation` via `TestData#rotation`. Everything else remains the same, just represented in a different format.

### The Game Test Instance

With the `TestData` in hand, we can now link everything together through the `GameTestInstance`. This instance is what actually represents a single test. Once again, vanilla only provides the default `minecraft:always_pass`, so we will need to construct the instance ourselves.

#### The Original Instance

The previous game tests are implemented using `minecraft:function`, which links a test function to the test data.

```json
// examplemod:example_test
// In 'data/examplemod/test_instance/example_test.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:function",

    // Points to a 'Consumer<GameTestHelper>' in the test function registry
    "function": "examplemod:example_function",

    // The 'TestData' information

    // The environment to run the test in
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
    "environment": "examplemod:example_environment",
    // The structure used for the game test
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/structure/example_structure.nbt'
    "structure": "examplemod:example_structure",
    // The number of ticks that the game test will run until it automatically fails
    "max_ticks": 400,
    // The number of ticks that are used to setup everying required for the game test
    // This is not counted towards the maximum number of ticks the test can take
    // If not specified, defaults to 0
    "setup_ticks": 50,
    // Whether the test is required to succeed to mark the batch run as successful
    // If not specified, defaults to true
    "required": true,
    // Specifies how the structure and all subsequent helper methods should be rotated for the test
    // If not specified, nothing is rotated
    "rotation": "clockwise_90",
    // When true, the test can only be ran through the `/test` command
    // If not specified, defaults to false
    "manual_only": true,
    // Specifies the maximum number of times that the test can be reran
    // If not specified, defaults to 1
    "max_attempts": 3,
    // Specifies the minimum number of successes that must occur for a test to be marked as successful
    // This must be less than or equal to the maximum number of attempts allowed
    // If not specified, defaults to 1
    "required_successes": 1,
    // Returns whether the structure boundary should keep the top empty
    // This is currently only used in block-based test instances
    // If not specified, defaults to false 
    "sky_access": false
}
```

#### Block-Based Instances

Vanilla also provides a block-based test instance via `minecraft:block_based`. This is handled through via structures with test blocks receiving signals via `Level#hasNeighborSignal`. To start, a structure must have one test block which is set to its start mode. This block is then triggered, sending a fifteen signal pulse for one tick. Structures may then have as many test blocks with either a log, accept, or fail mode set. Log test blocks also send a fifteen signal pulse when activated. Accept and fail test blocks either succeed or fail the game test if any of them are activated (success takes precedent over failure).

As this test relies on test blocks in the structure, no additional information is required other than the test data:

```json
// examplemod:example_test
// In 'data/examplemod/test_instance/example_test.json'
{
    "type": "minecraft:block_based",

    // The 'TestData' information

    // Points to 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
    "environment": "examplemod:example_environment",
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/structure/example_structure.nbt'
    "structure": "examplemod:example_structure",
    "max_ticks": 400,
    "setup_ticks": 50,
    "required": true,
    "rotation": "clockwise_90",
    "manual_only": true,
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "required_successes": 1,
    "sky_access": false
}
```

#### Custom Tests

If you need to implement your own test-based logic, whether using a more dynamic feature ~~or because you can't be bothered to migrated all of your data logic to the new systems~~, you can create your own custom test instance by extending `GameTestInstance` and creating an associated `MapCodec`:

```java
public class ExampleTestInstance extends GameTestInstance {

    // Construct the map codec to register
    public static final MapCodec<ExampleTestInstance> CODEC = RecordCodecBuilder.mapCodec(instance -> instance.group(
            Codec.INT.fieldOf("value1").forGetter(test -> test.value1),
            Codec.BOOL.fieldOf("value2").forGetter(test -> test.value2),
            TestData.CODEC.forGetter(ExampleTestInstance::info)
        ).apply(instance, ExampleTestInstance::new)
    );

    public ExampleTestInstance(int value1, boolean value2, TestData<Holder<TestEnvironmentDefinition>> info) {
        super(info);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(GameTestHelper helper) {
        // Run whatever game test commands you want
        helper.assertBlockPresent(...);

        // Make sure you have some way to succeed
        helper.succeedIf(() -> ...);
    }

    @Override
    public MapCodec<ExampleTestInstance> codec() {
        return CODEC;
    }

    @Override
    protected MutableComponent typeDescription() {
        // Provides a description about what this test is supposed to be
        // Should use a translatable component
        return Component.literal("Example Test Instance");
    }
}
```

Then register the `MapCodec` using whatever registry method is required by your mod loader:

```java
Registry.register(
    BuiltInRegistries.TEST_INSTANCE_TYPE,
    ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_test_instance"),
    ExampleTestInstance.CODEC
);
```

Finally, you can use it in your test instance:

```json
// examplemod:example_test
// In 'data/examplemod/test_instance/example_test.json'
{
    "type": "examplemod:example_test_instance",

    "value1": 0,
    "value2": true,

    // The 'TestData' information

    // Points to 'data/examplemod/test_environment/example_environment.json'
    "environment": "examplemod:example_environment",
    // Points to 'data/examplemod/structure/example_structure.nbt'
    "structure": "examplemod:example_structure",
    "max_ticks": 400,
    "setup_ticks": 50,
    "required": true,
    "rotation": "clockwise_90",
    "manual_only": true,
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "required_successes": 1,
    "sky_access": false

## Data Component Getters

The data component system can now be represented on arbitrary objects through the use of the `DataComponentGetter`. As the name implies, the getter is responsible for getting the component from the associated type key. Both block entities and entities use the `DataComponentGetter` to allow querying the internal data, such as variant information or custom names. They both also have methods for collecting the data components from another holder (via `applyImplicitComponents` or `applyImplicitComponent`). Block entities also contain a method for collection to another holder via `collectImplicitComponents`.

#### Spawn Conditions

To allow entities to spawn variants randomly but within given conditions, a new registry called `SPAWN_CONDITION_TYPE` was added. These take in `SpawnCondition`s: a selector that acts like a predicate to take in the context to see whether the given variant can spawn there. All of the variants are thrown into a list and then ordered based on the selected priorty stored in the `SpawnProritySelectors`. Those with a higher priority will be checked first, with multiple of the same priority selected in the order they are provided. Then, all variants on the same priority level where a condition has been met is selected at random.

```json5
// For some object where there are spawn conditions
[
    {
        // The spawn condition being checked
        "condition": {
            "type": "minecraft:biome",
            // Will check that the biome the variant is attempting to spawn in is in the forest
            "biomes": "#minecraft:is_forest"
        },
        // Will check this condition first
        "priority": 1
    },
    {
        // States that the condition will always be true
        "priority": 0
    }
]
```

#### Variant Datapack Registries

Frog, cat, cow, chicken, pig, and wolf, and wolf sound variants are datapack registry objects, meaning that most references now need to be referred to through the `RegistryAccess` or `HolderLookup$Provider` instance.

For a frog, cat, or wolf:

```json5
// A file located at:
// - `data/examplemod/frog_variant/example_frog.json`
// - `data/examplemod/cat_variant/example_cat.json`
// - `data/examplemod/wolf_variant/example_wolf.json`
{
    // Points to a texture at `assets/examplemod/textures/entity/cat/example_cat.png`
    "asset_id": "examplemod:entity/cat/example_cat",
    "spawn_conditions": [
        // The conditions for this variant to spawn
        {
            "priority": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

For a pig, cow, or chicken:
```json5
// A file located at:
// - `data/examplemod/pig_variant/example_pig.json`
// - `data/examplemod/cow_variant/example_cow.json`
// - `data/examplemod/chicken_variant/example_chicken.json`
{
    // Points to a texture at `assets/examplemod/textures/entity/pig/example_pig.png`
    "asset_id": "examplemod:entity/pig/example_pig",
    // Defines the `PigVariant$ModelType` that's used to select what entity model to render the pig variant with
    "model": "cold",
    "spawn_conditions": [
        // The conditions for this variant to spawn
        {
            "priority": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

For a wolf sound variant:
```json5
// A file located at:
// - `data/examplemod/wolf_sound_variant/example_wolf_sound.json``
{
    // The registry name of the sound event to play randomly on idle
    "ambient_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.ambient",
    // The registry name of the sound event to play when killed
    "death_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.death",
    // The registry name of the sound event to play randomly when angry on idle
    "growl_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.growl",
    // The registry name of the sound event to play when hurt
    "hurt_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.hurt",
    // The registry name of the sound event to play randomly
    // 1/3 of the time on idle when health is max
    "pant_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.pant",
    // The registry name of the sound event to play randomly
    // 1/3 of the time on idle when health is below max
    "whine_sound": "minecraft:entity.wolf.whine"
}
```

#### Client Assets

Raw `ResourceLocation`s within client-facing files for identifiers or textures are being replaced with objects defining an idenfitier along with a potential texture path. There are three main objects to be aware of: `ClientAsset`, `ModelAndTexture`, and `MaterialAssetGroup`.

`ClientAsset` is an id/texture pair used to point to a texture location. By default, the texture path is contructed from the id, with the path prefixed with `textures` and suffixed with the PNG extension.

`ModelAndTexture` is a object/client asset pair used when a renderer should select between multiple models. Usually, the renderer creates a map of the object type to the model, and the object provided to the `ModelAndTexture` is used as a lookup into the map.

`MaterialAssetGroup` is a handler for rendering an equipment asset with some trim material. It takes in the base texture used to overlay onto the armor along with any overrides for a given equipment asset.

- `net.minecraft.data.loot.EntityLootSubProvider#killedByFrogVariant` now takes in a `HolderGetter` for the `FrogVariant`
- `net.minecraft.data.tags.CatVariantTagsProvider` class is removed
- `net.minecraft.tags.CatVariantTags` class is removed

    - `MaterialAssetGroup` - An asset defines some base and the permutations based on the equipment worn.
    - `TrimMaterial` now takes in a `MaterialAssetGroup` instead of the raw base and overrides

## Tags and Parsing

Tags have received a rewrite, removing any direct references to types while also sealing and finalizing related classes. Getting a value from the tag now returns an `Optional`-wrapped entry, unless you call one of the `get*Or`, where you specify the default value. Objects, on the other hand, do not take in a default, instead returning an empty variant of the desired tag.

```java
// For some `CompoundTag` tag

// Read a value
Optional<Integer> value1 = tag.getInt("value1");
int value1Raw = tag.getIntOr("value1", 0);

// Reading another object
Optional<CompoundTag> childTag = tag.getCompound("childTag");
CompoundTag childTagRaw = tag.getCopmoundOrEmpty("childTag");
```

### Writing with Codecs

`CompoundTag`s now have methods to write and read using a `Codec` or `MapCodec`. For a `Codec`, it will store the serialized data inside the key specified. For a `MapCodec`, it will merge the fields onto the top level tag.

```java
// For some Codec<ExampleObject> CODEC and MapCodec<ExampleObject> MAP_CODEC
// We will also have ExampleObject example
CompoundTag tag = new CompoundTag();

// For a codec
tag.store("example_key", CODEC, example);
Optional<ExampleObject> fromCodec = tag.read("example_key", CODEC);

// For a map codec
tag.store(MAP_CODEC, example);
Optional<ExampleObject> fromMapCodec = tag.read(MAP_CODEC);
```

### Command Parsers

The packrat parser has been updated with new rules and systems, allowing commands to have parser-based arguments. This comes from the `CommandArgumentParser`, which parses some grammar to return the desired object. The parser is then consumed by the `ParserBasedArgument`, where it attempts to parse a string and build any suggestions based on what you're currently typing. These are both handled through the `Grammar` class, which implements `CommandArgumentParser`, constructed using a combination of atoms, dictionaries, rules, and terms.

## Saved Data, now with Types

`SavedData` has been reworked to abstract most of its save and loading logic into a separate `SavedDataType`. This means that the `save` override and additional `load` and `factory` methods are now handled within the `SavedDataType` itself.

To construct a `SavedDataType`, you need to pass in four paramters. First is the string identifier, used to resolve the `.dat` file holding your information. This must be a vaild path. Then there is the constructor, which takes in the `SavedData$Context` to return an instance of your data object when no information is present. Following that is the codec, which takes in the `SavedData$Context` and returns a `Codec` to read and write your saved data. Finally, there is the `DataFixTypes` used for data fixers. As this is a static enum, you will either need to inject into the enum itself, if you plan on using vanilla data fixers, or patch out the `update` call within `DimensionDataStorage#readTagFromDisk` to pass in a null value.

```java
// Our saved data instance
public class ExampleSavedData extends SavedData {

    // The saved data type
    public static final SavedDataType<ExampleSavedData> TYPE = new SavedDataType<>(
        // Best to preface the identifier with your mod id followed by an underscore
        // Slashes will throw an error as the folders are not present
        // Will resolve to `saves/<world_name>/data/examplemod_example.dat`
        "examplemod_example",
        // Constructor for the new instance
        ExampleSavedData::new,
        // Codec factory to encode and decode the data
        ctx -> RecordCodecBuilder.create(instance -> instance.group(
            RecordCodecBuilder.point(ctx.levelOrThrow()),
            Codec.INT.fieldOf("value1").forGetter(data -> data.value1),
            Codec.BOOL.fieldOf("value2").forGetter(data -> data.value2)
        ).apply(instance, ExampleSavedData::new));
    );

    private final ServerLevel level;
    private final int value1;
    private final boolean value2;


    // For the new instance
    private ExampleSavedData(ServerLevel.Context ctx) {
        this(ctx.levelOrThrow(), 0, false);
    }

    // For the codec
    // The constructors don't need to be public if not using `DimensionDataStorage#set`
    private ExampleSavedData(ServerLevel level, int value1, boolean value2) {
        this.level = level;
        this.value1 = value1;
        this.value2 = value2;
    }

    // Other methods here
}

## Render Pipeline Rework

Rendering an object to the screen, whether through a shader or a `RenderType`, has been fully or partially reworked, depending on what systems you were using previously. As such, a lot of things need to be reexplained, which a more in-depth look will be below. However, for the people who don't care, here's the TL;DR.

First, shader JSONs no longer exist. This is replaced by a `RenderPipeline`, which is effectively an in-code substitute. Second, the `RenderPipeline`s forcibly make most abtrarily values into objects. For example, instead of storing the blend function mode id, you store a `BlendFunction` object. Similarly, you no longer store or setup the direct texture objects, but instead manage it through a `GpuTexture`. Finally, the `VertexBuffer` can either draw to the framebuffer by directly passing in the `RenderPipeline`, updating any necessary uniforms in the consumer, or by passing in the `RenderType`.

Now, for those who need the details, let's jump into them.

### Abstracting Open GL

As many are aware, Minecraft has been abstracting away their OpenGL calls and constants, and this release is no different. All of the calls to GL codes, except `BufferUsage`, have been moved out of object references, to be obtained typically by calling `GlConst$toGl`. However, with all of the other rendering reworks, there are numerous changes and complexities that require learning an entirely new system, assuming you're not using `RenderType`s.

Starting from the top, all calls to the underlying render system goes through `GpuDevice`, an interface that acts like a general implementation of a render library like OpenGL or Vulkan. The device is responsible for creating buffers and textures, executing whatever commands are desired. Getting the current `GpuDevice` can be accessed through the `RenderSystem` via `getDevice` like so:

```java
GpuDevice device = RenderSystem.getDevice();
```

The `GpuDevice` can the create either buffers with the desired data or a texture containing information on what to render using `createBuffer` and `createTexture`, respectively. Just for redundancy, buffers hold the vertex data while textures hold the texture (color and depth) data. You should generally cache the buffer or texture object for later use with any additional data updated as needed. For reference, buffers are typically created by using a `BufferBuilder` with a `ByteBufferBuilder` to build the `MeshData` first, before passing that into `createBuffer`.

With the desired buffers and textures set up, how do we actually modify render them to the screen? Well, this is handled through the `CommandEncoder`, which can also be optained from the device via `GpuDevice#createCommandEncoder`. The encoder contain the familiar read and write methods along with a few extra to clear texture to a given color or simply blit the the texture immediately to the screen (`presentTexture`). However, the most important method here is `createRenderPass`. This takes in the `GpuTexture` to draw to the screen along with a default ARGB color for the background. Additionally, it can take in a depth texture as well. This should be created using a try with resources block like so:

```java
// We will assume you have constructed a `GpuTexture` texture for the color data
try (RenderPass pass = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().createRenderPass(this.texture, OptionalInt.of(0xFFFFFFFF))) {
    // Setup things here

}
```

Within the `RenderPass`, you can set the `RenderPipeline` to use, which defines the associated shaders, bind any samplers from other targets or set uniforms, scissor a part of a screen to render, and set the vertex and index buffers used to define the vertices to render. Finally, everything can be drawn to the screen using one of the `draw` methods, providing the starting index and the vertex count.

```java
// If the buffers/textures are not created or cached, create them here
// Any methods ran from `CommandEncoder` cannot be run while a render pass is open
RenderSystem.AutoStorageIndexBuffer indices = RenderSystem.getSequentialBuffer(VertexFormat.Mode.QUADS);
GpuBuffer vertexBuffer = RenderSystem.getQuadVertexBuffer();
GpuBuffer indexBuffer = indices.getBuffer(6);

// We will assume you have constructed a `GpuTexture` texture for the color data
try (RenderPass pass = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().createRenderPass(this.texture, OptionalInt.of(0xFFFFFFFF))) {

    // Set pipeline information along with any samplers and uniforms
    pass.setPipeline(EXAMPLE_PIPELINE);
    pass.setVertexBuffer(0, vertexBuffer);
    pass.setIndexBuffer(indexBuffer, indices.type());
    pass.bindSampler("Sampler0", RenderSystem.getShaderTexture(0));

    // Then, draw everything to the screen
    // In this example, the buffer just contains a single quad
    // For those unaware, the vertex count is 6 as a quad is made up of 2 triangles, so 2 vertices overlap
    pass.drawIndexed(0, 6);
}
```

However, unless you need such fine control, it is recommended to use a `RenderType` with the `MultiBufferSource` when necessary as that sets up most things for you.

### Object References

Most raw references to GL codes used for determining the mode and handling the texture have been replaced with objects. As the TL;DR previously mentioned, these are stored typically as some sort of enum or object that can then be resolved to their GL counterparts. Some objects contain their reference identifier directly, like `BlendFunction`. Others are simply placeholders that are resolved in their appropriate location, like `DepthTestFunction` whose enum values are converted via `RenderPipeline#toGl`.

However, the biggest change is the addition of the `GpuTexture`. This is responsible for managing anything to do with creating, writing, and releasing a texture written to some buffer. At initialization, the texture is created and bound, with any necessary parameters set for mipmaps and texture formats. These `GpuTexture`s are stored and referenced everywhere, from the depth and color targets for a `RenderTarget` to the texture backing a `TextureAtlas`. Then, once no longer need, the texture is released by calling `#close`. Note that although technically `#bind` can be called again, the texture is already considered deleted and should not be used.

If, for some reason, you need to use a `GpuTexture`, it's actually quite simple to use. First, you just construct the `GpuTexture` via `GpuDevice#createTexture`. Then, if you need to change any of the addressing or texture mipmap filters, you can apply them whenever before writing.

```java
public class MyTextureManager {
    
    private final GpuTexture texture;

    public MyTextureManager() {
        this.texture = RenderSystem.getDevice().createTexture(
            // The texture name, used for logging and debugging
            "Example Texture",
            // The format of the texture pixels, can be one of three values that
            // Values:   (texture internal format, texel data format,  texel data type,  pixel size)
            // - RGBA8   (GL_RGBA8,                GL_RGBA,            GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 4)
            // - RED8    (GL_R8,                   GL_RED,             GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 1)
            // - DEPTH32 (GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32,    GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_FLOAT,         4)
            TextureFormat.RGBA8,
            // Width of the texture
            16,
            // Height of the texture
            16,
            // The mipmap level and maximum level-of-detail (minimum of 1)
            1
        );

        // Set the texture mode for the UV component
        // Values:
        // - REPEAT        (GL_REPEAT)
        // - CLAMP_TO_EDGE (GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE)
        this.texture.setAddressMode(
            // The mode to use for the U component (GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S)
            AddressMode.CLAMP_TO_EDGE,
            // The mode to use for the V component (GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R)
            AddressMode.REPEAT
        );

        // Sets the filter functions used for scaling the texture on the screen
        // Values    (default,    for mipmaps):
        // - NEAREST (GL_NEAREST, GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR)
        // - LINEAR  (GL_LINEAR,  GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR)
        this.texture.setTextureFilter(
            // The mode to use for the texture minifying function (GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER)
            FilterMode.LINEAR,
            // The mode to use for the texture magnifying function (GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER)
            FilterMode.NEAREST,
            // Whether mipmaps should be used for the minifying function (should have a higher mipmap level than 1 when true)
            false
        );
    }
}
```

Then, whenever you want to upload something to the texture, you call `CommandEncoder#writeToTexture` or `CommandEncoder#copyTextureToTexture`. This either takes in the `NativeImage` to write from or an `IntBuffer` with the texture data and a `NativeImage$Format` to use.

```java
// Like other buffer/texture modification methods, this must be done outside of a render pass
// We will assume you have some `NativeImage` image to load into the texture
RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().writeToTexture(
    // The texture (destination) being written to
    this.texture,
    // The image (source) being read from
    image,
    // The mipmap level
    0,
    // The starting destination x offset
    0,
    // The starting destination y offset
    0,
    // The destination width (x size)
    16,
    // The desintation height (y size)
    16,
    // The starting source x offset
    0,
    // The starting source y offset
    0
)
```

Finally, once you're done with the texture, don't forget to release it via `#close` if it's not already handled for you.

### Render Pipelines

Previously, a pipeline was constructed using a JSON that contained all metadata from the vertex and fragement shader to their defined values, samplers, and uniforms. However, this has all been replaced with an in-code solution that more localizes some parts of the JSON and some parts that were relegated to the `RenderType`. This is known as a `RenderPipeline`.

A `RenderPipeline` can be constructed using its builder via `RenderPipeline#builder`. A pipeline can then be built by calling `build`. If you want the shader to be pre-compiled without any additional work, the final pipeline can be passed to `RenderPipeline#register`. However, you can also handle the compilation yourself if more graceful fail states are desired. If you have snippets that are used across multiple pipelines, then a partial pipeline can be built via `$Builder#buildSnippet` and then passed to the constructing pipelines in the `builder` method.

> The following enums described in the examples have their GL codes provided with them as they have been abstracted away.

```java
// This assumes that RenderPipeline#register has been made public through some form
public static final RenderPipeline EXAMPLE_PIPELINE = RenderPipelines.register(
    RenderPipeline.builder()
    // The name of the pipeline (required)
    .withLocation(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "pipeline/example"))
    // The location of the vertex shader, relative to 'shaders' (required)
    // Points to 'assets/examplemod/shaders/example.vsh'
    .withVertexShader(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example"))
    // The location of the fragment shader, relative to 'shaders' (required)
    // Points to 'assets/examplemod/shaders/example.fsh'
    .withFragmentShader(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example"))
    // The format of the vertices within the shader (required)
    .withVertexFormat(
        // The vertex format
        DefaultVertexFormat.POSITION_TEX_COLOR,
        // The mode of the format
        VertexFormat.Mode.QUADS
    )
    // Adds constants that can be referenced within the shaders
    // Can specify a name in addition to an int / float to represent its value
    // If no value is specified, then it should be gated with a #ifdef / #endif block
    .withShaderDefines("ALPHA_CUTOUT", 0.5)
    // Adds the texture sampler2Ds that can be referenced within the shaders
    // Typically, the shader textures stored in the `RenderSystem` is referenced via `Sampler0` - `Sampler11`
    // - `Sampler0` is usually always present, but these should be set up beforehand
    // Additionally, for render targets, `InSampler` is typically present, along with any defined in a postpass
    .withSampler("Sampler0")
    // Adds uniforms that can be referenced within the shaders
    // These are just definitions which are then populated by default or by the caller depending on the scenario
    // Defaults can be found in `CompiledShaderProgram#setupUniforms`
    .withUniform("ModelOffset", UniformType.VEC3)
    // Custom uniforms must be set manually as the vanilla batching system does not support such an operation
    .withUniform("CustomUniform", UniformType.INT)
    // Sets the depth test functions used rendering objects at varying distances from the camera
    // Values:
    // - NO_DEPTH_TEST      (GL_ALWAYS)
    // - EQUAL_DEPTH_TEST   (GL_EQUAL)
    // - LEQUAL_DEPTH_TEST  (GL_LEQUAL)
    // - LESS_DEPTH_TEST    (GL_LESS)
    // - GREATER_DEPTH_TEST (GL_GREATER)
    .withDepthTestFunction(DepthTestFunction.LEQUAL_DEPTH_TEST)
    // Sets how the polygons should render
    // Values:
    // - FILL      (GL_FILL)
    // - WIREFRAME (GL_LINE)
    .withPolygonMode(PolygonMode.FILL)
    // When true, can cull front or back-facing polygons
    .withCull(false)
    // Specifies the functions to use when blending two colors with alphas together
    // Made up of the `GlStateManager$SourceFactor` and `GlStateManager$DestFactor`
    // First two are for RGB, the last two are for alphas
    // If nothing is specified, then blending is disabled
    .withBlend(BlendFunction.TRANSLUCENT)
    // Determines whether to mask writing colors and alpha to the draw buffer
    .withColorWrite(
        // Mask RGB
        false,
        // Mask alpha
        false
    )
    // Determines whether to mask writing values to the depth buffer
    .withDepthWrite(false)
    // Determines the logical operation to apply when applying an RGBA color to the framebuffer
    .withColorLogic(LogicOp.NONE)
    // Sets the scale and units used to calculate the depth values for the polygon.
    // This takes the place of the polygon offset.
    .withDepthBias(0f, 0f)
    .build()
);
```

From there, the pipeline can either be used directly or through some `RenderType`:

```java
// This will assume that RenderType#create is made public
public static final RenderType EXAMPLE_RENDER_TYPE = RenderType.create(
    // The name of the render type
    "examplemod:example",
    // The size of the buffer
    // Or 4MB
    4194304,
    // Whether it effects crumbling that is applied to block entities
    false,
    // Whether the vertices should be sorted before upload
    true,
    // The pipeline to use
    EXAMPLE_PIPIELINE,
    // Any additional composite state settings to apply
    RenderType.CompositeState.builder().createCompositeState(RenderType.OutlineProperty.NONE)
);
```

The pipeline can then be drawn by creating the `RenderPass` and setting the `RenderPipeline` to use your pipeline. As for the `RenderType`, the associated buffer can be obtained using  `MultiBufferSource#getBuffer`. Note that custom uniforms should not be used within `RenderType`s as they cannot be set easily.

```java
// Since we are using a custom uniform, we must handle it ourselves
// We will assume we have some `GpuTexture` texture to write to

// Create the render pass to use
try (RenderPass pass = RenderSystem.getDevice().createCommandEncoder().createRenderPass(
        // The GPU color texture to write to
        this.texture,
        // The clear color in ARGB format
        OptionalInt.of(0xFFFFFFFF),
        // The depth texture and the clear depth value can also be constructed here
    )
) {
    // Add the pipeline and our uniform
    pass.setPipeline(EXAMPLE_PIPELINE);
    pass.setUniform("CustomUniform", 1);
    
    // Set any additional sampler and the vertex/index buffers to use

    // Finally, call one of the draw functions
    // Takes in the first index and the index count to draw for the vertices
    pass.draw(...);
}
```

### Post Effects

Given that the pipeline JSONs have been stripped, this also effects the post effects. The `program` is replaced with directly specifying the `vertex_shader` and the `fragment_shader`. Additionally, uniforms must specify their `type`.

```json5
// Before 1.21.5 (for some pass in 'passes')
{
    // Same as before
    "inputs": [ /*...*/ ],
    "output": "swap",

    // Replaced by 'vertex_shader', 'fragement_shader'
    "program": "minecraft:post/box_blur",

    "uniforms": [
        {
            "name": "BlurDir",
            // Required
            "values": [ 1.0, 0.0 ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Radius",
            // Required
            "values": [ 0.0 ]
        }
    ]
}

// 1.21.1 (for some pass in 'passes')
{
    // Same as before
    "inputs": [ /*...*/ ],
    "output": "swap",

    // Relative to 'shaders'
    // Points to 'assets/minecraft/shaders/post/blur.vsh'
    "vertex_shader": "minecraft:post/blur",
    // Points to 'assets/minecraft/shaders/post/box_blur.fsh'
    "fragment_shader": "minecraft:post/box_blur",


    "uniforms": [
        {
            "name": "BlurDir",
            // Specifies the type to use for this uniform
            // One of `Uniform$Type`:
            // - int
            // - ivec3
            // - float
            // - vec2
            // - vec3
            // - vec4
            // - matrix4x4
            "type": "vec2",
            "values": [ 1.0, 0.0 ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Radius",
            "type": "float"
            // Values are no longer required
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that if you do not define a value for a uniform, they still must be specified before processing the `PostChain` by calling `#setUniform` within the `RenderPass` consumer of `PostChain#process`.

```java
// Assume we already got the `PostChain` post
post.process(Minecraft.getInstance().getMainRenderTarget(), GraphicsResourceAllocator.UNPOOLED, pass -> {
    pass.setUniform("Radius", 0.4f);
});

## Model Rework

The model system has been further separated into models for block states, blocks, and items. As such, the unifying `BakedModel` has been completely removed and separated into their own  sections, loaded in three steps: from JSON, resolving dependencies, and then baking for use with the associated block state model or item model. For reference, everything discussed below is what's happenening within `ModelManager#reload` in parallel.

First, let's start from the base model JSON used between blocks and items. These are loaded into an `UnbakedModel` (specifically `BlockModel`) which contains the familiar properties such as gui light and texture slots. However, one change is the splitting of the elements from their render settings. These elements that hold the render quads are stored in an `UnbakedGeometry`. The `UnbakedGeometry` is responsible for baking the model into a `QuadCollection`, which effectively holds the list of `BakedQuad`s to render. Currently, vanilla only has the `SimpleUnbakedGeometry`, which holds the familiar list of `BlockElement`s. These `UnbakedModel`, once loaded, are then passed to the `ModelDiscovery` for resolving the block state and item models.

Next we have the `ResolvableModel`s, which is the base of both block state and item models. These models essentially function as markers requesting the `UnbakedModel`s that they will be using. From there, we have their subtypes `BlockStateModel$UnbakedRoot` for the block state JSON and `ItemModel$Unbaked` for the model referenced in the client item JSON. Each of these implement `resolveDependencies` in some way to call `ResolvableModel$Resolver#markDependency` with the model location they would like to use.

> Technically, `BlockStateModel`s are a bit more complex as variants use `BlockStateModel$Unbaked` during loading which are then transformed into an `$UnbakedRoot` during initialization.

Now that we know what models that should be loaded, they now have to be put into a usable state for baking. This is the job of the `ModelDiscovery`, which takes in a `ResolvableModel` and loads the `UnbakedModel`s into a `ResolvedModel` on first reference. `ResolvedModel`s are functionally wrappers around `UnbakedModel`s used to resolve all dependency chains, as the name implies.

From there, model groups are built for `BlockState`s and the textures are loaded, leading to the final step of actually baking the `BlockStateModel` and the `ItemModel`. This is handled through the `bake` methods provided on the `$UnbakedRoot` (or `$Unbaked`) and the `ModelBakery`. In a nutshell, `bake` constructs the list of `BakedQuad`s stored with whatever additional information is desired by the block state or item model itself. The `ResolvedModel`s are obtained from the baker, from which the instance methods are called. For `BlockStateModel`s, this is resolved via `SimpleModelWrapper#bake`, from which the `ModelState` is obtained from the `Variant` data. They stored the baked quads in a `BlockModelPart`. For `ItemModel`s, it just consumes the `BakedQuad`s list directly along with information provided by `ModelRenderProperties#fromResolvedModel`. This does mean that each `BlockStateModel` and `ItemModel` may contain duplicated (but unique) `BakedQuad`s if the same model is referenced in multiple locations.

### Block Generators: The Variant Mutator

Given all the changes that separated out the block state JSON loading, there have also been a number of changes to the `BlockModelGenerators`. While most of them are simply renames (e.g., `BlockStateGenerator` -> `BlockModelDefinitionGenerator`), the major change is the addition of the `VariantMutator`. The `VariantMutator` is functionally a `UnaryOperator` on a `Variant` used to set some setting. This addition has simplified (or more like codec construction) the use of the `PropertyDispatch` for more quickly dispatching blocks with variants based on their properties.

```java
// Creates a property dispatch on the horizontal facing property
// Applies the associated variants, though if desired, a functional interface can be provided instead
public static final PropertyDispatch<VariantMutator> ROTATION_HORIZONTAL_FACING = PropertyDispatch.modify(BlockStateProperties.HORIZONTAL_FACING)
    .select(Direction.EAST, BlockModelGenerators.Y_ROT_90)
    .select(Direction.SOUTH, BlockModelGenerators.Y_ROT_180)
    .select(Direction.WEST, BlockModelGenerators.Y_ROT_270)
    .select(Direction.NORTH, BlockModelGenerators.NOP);

// Then, with access to the `Consumer<BlockModelDefinitionGenerator>` blockStateOutput
this.blockStateOutput.accept(
    MultiVariantGenerator.dispatch(EXAMPLE_BLOCK).with(ROTATION_HORIZONTAL_FACING)
);

## Minor Migrations

The following is a list of useful or interesting additions, changes, and removals that do not deserve their own section in the primer.

### Entity References

Generally, the point of storing the UUID of another entity was to later grab that entity to perform some logic. However, storing the raw entity could lead to issues if the entity was removed at some point in time. As such, the `EntityReference` was added to handle resolving the entity from its UUID while also making sure it still existed at the time of query.

An `EntityReference` is simply a wrapped `Either` which either holds the entity instance or the UUID. When resolving via `getEntity`, it will attempt to verify that the stored entity, when present, isn't removed. If it is, it grabs the UUID to perform another lookup for the entity itself. If that entity does exist, it will be return, or otherwise null.

Most references to a UUID within an entity have been replaced with an `EntityReference` to facilitate this change.

- `net.minecraft.network.syncher.EntityDataSerializers#OPTIONAL_UUID` -> `OPTIONAL_LIVING_ENTITY_REFERENCE`, not one to one as it can hold the entity reference
- `net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel#getEntity(UUID)` -> `Level#getEntity(UUID)`
- `net.minecraft.world.entity`
    - `EntityReference` - A reference to an entity either by its entity instance when present in the world, or a UUID.
    - `LivingEntity#lastHurtByPlayer`, `lastHurtByMob` are now `EntityReference`s
    - `OwnableEntity`
        - `getOwnerUUID` -> `getOwnerReference`, not one-to-one
        - `level` now returns a `Level` instead of an `EntityGetter`
    - `TamableAnimal#setOwnerUUID` -> `setOwner`, or `setOwnerReference`; not one-to-one
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.animal.horse.AbstractHorse#setOwnerUUID` -> `setOwner`, not one-to-one
- `net.minecraft.world.level.Level` now implements `UUIDLookup<Entity>`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.entity`
    - `EntityAccess` now implements `UniquelyIdentifyable`
    - `UniquelyIdentifyable` - An interface that claims the object as a UUID and keeps tracks of whether the object is removed or not.
    - `UUIDLookup` - An interface that looks up a type by its UUID.

### Descoping Player Arguments

Many methods that take in the `Player` has been descoped to take in a `LivingEntity` or `Entity` depending on the usecase. The following methods below are a non-exhaustive list of this.

- `net.minecraft.world.entity.EntityType`
    - `spawn`
    - `createDefaultStackConfig`, `appendDefaultStackConfig`
    - `appendCustomEntityStackConfig`, `updateCustomEntityTag`
- `net.minecraft.world.item`
    - `BucketItem#playEmptySound`
    - `DispensibleContainerItem#checkExtraContent`, `emptyContents`
- `net.minecraft.world.level`
    - `Level`
        - `playSeededSound`
        - `mayInteract`
    - `LevelAccessor`
        - `playSound`
        - `levelEvent`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block`
    - `BucketPickup#pickupBlock`
    - `LiquidBlockContainer#canPlaceLiquid`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.BrushableBlockEntity#brush`

### Component Interaction Events

Click and hover events on a `MutableComponent` have been reworked into `MapCodec` registry-like system. They are both now interfaces that register their codecs to an `$Action` enum. The implementation then creates a codec that references the `$Action` type and stores any necessary information that is needed for the logic to apply. However, there is no direct 'action' logic associated with the component interactions. Instead, they are hardcoded into their use locations. For click events, this is within `Screen#handleComponentClicked`. For hover events, this is in `GuiGraphics#renderComponentHoverEffect`. As such, any additional events added will need to inject into both the enum and one or both of these locations.

- `net.minecraft.network.chat`
    - `ClickEvent` is now an interface
        - `getAction` -> `action`
        - `getValue` is now on the subclasses as necessary for their individual types
    - `HoverEvent` is now an interface
        - `getAction` -> `action`
        - `$EntityTooltipInfo`
            - `CODEC` is now a `MapCodec`
            - `legacyCreate` is removed
        - `$ItemStackInfo` is removed, replaced by `$ShowItem`
        - `$LegacyConverter` interface is removed

### Texture Atlas Reworks

The texture atlas logic has been finalized into a registry codec system; however, the querying of the atlas data has changed. First, all atlas identifiers are stored within `AtlasIds` while the corresponding texture location is stored within `Sheets`. To get a material from an atlas, a `MaterialMapper` is used as a wrapper around the texture location and the associated prefix to append to the material. The `Material` can then be obtained using `apply` by passing in the id of the material you would like to use.

For example:

```java
// Found in sheets
public static final MaterialMapper ITEMS_MAPPER = new MaterialMapper(TextureAtlas.LOCATION_BLOCKS, "item");
public static final MaterialMapper BLOCKS_MAPPER = new MaterialMapper(TextureAtlas.LOCATION_BLOCKS, "block");

// Finds the texture for the material at `assets/examplemod/textures/item/example_item.png`
public static final Material EXAMPLE_ITEM = ITEMS_MAPPER.apply(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_item"));

// Finds the texture for the material at `assets/examplemod/textures/block/example/block.png`
public static final Material EXAMPLE_BLOCK = ITEMS_MAPPER.apply(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example/block"));
```

- `net.minecraft.client.data.AtlasProvider` - A data provider for generating the providers of a texture atlas.
- `net.minecraft.client.data.models.ItemModelGenerators`
    - `SLOT_*` -> `TRIM_PREFIX_*`, now public and `ResourceLocation`s
    - `TRIM_MATERIAL_MODELS` is now public
    - `generateTrimmableItem` now takes in a `ResourceLocation` instead of a `String`
    - `$TrimMaterialData` is now public, taking in a `MaterialAssetGroup` instead of the name and override materials
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer`
    - `MaterialMapper` - An object that stores the location of the atlas texture and the prefix applied to the ids within the texture.
    - `Sheets`
        - `*_MAPPER` - `MaterialMapper`s for each texture atlas texture.
        - `createBedMaterial(ResourceLocation)` is removed
        - `createShulkerMaterial(ResourceLocation)` is removed
        - `createSignMaterial(ResourceLocation)` is removed
        - `chestMaterial(String)`, `chestMaterial(ResourceLocation)` are removed
        - `createDecoratedPotMaterial(ResourceLocation)` is removed
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.blockentity.ConduitRenderer#MAPPER` - A mapper to get the conduit textures from the block atlas.
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.texture.atlas`
    - `SpriteSource#type` -> `codec`, not one-to-one
    - `SpriteSources` now contains logic similar to client registries via their id mapper
    - `SpriteSourceType` record is removed
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.texture.atlas.sources`
    - `DirectoryLister` is now a record
    - `PalettedPermutations` is now a record
    - `SingleFile` is now a record
    - `SourceFilter` is now a record
    - `Unstitcher` is now a record
        - `$Region` is now public
- `net.minecraft.client.resources.model.AtlasIds` - A class which holds the `ResourceLocation`s of all vanilla texture atlases.

### Registry Context Swapper

Client items now store a `RegistryContextSwapper`, which is used to properly check client item information that accesses registry objects. Before level load, this is provided a placeholder to avoid crashing and populated with the correct value during rendering.

- `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer`
    - `CacheSlot` - An object that contains a value computed from some context. When updated, the previous value is overwritten and the context registers the slot to be cleaned.
    - `ClientLevel` now implements `CacheSlot$Cleaner`
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.item`
    - `ClientItem` can now take in a nullable `RegistryContextSwapper`
        - `withRegistrySwapper` - Sets the `RegistryContextSwapper` within a `ClientItem`
    - `ItemModel$BakingContext` now takes in a `RegistryContextSwapper`
- `net.minecraft.util`
    - `PlaceholderLookupProvider` - A provider that contains placeholders for referenced objects. Used within client items as they will be loaded before the `RegistyAccess` is populated.
    - `RegistryContextSwapper` - An interface used to swap out some object for a different one. Used by client items to swap the placeholders for the loaded `RegistryAccess`.

### Reload Instance Creation

Reload instances have been slightly rearranged. The `SimpleReloadInstance` base now only takes in the `List<PreparableReloadListener>`, where the other fields are passed into the `of` function such that `#startTasks` can be called immediately.

- `net.minecraft.server.packs.resources`
    - `ProfiledReloadInstance` construct is now private, accessed through `of`
    - `SimpleReloadInstance` only takes in the `List<PreparableReloadListener>`
        - `of` now returns a `ReloadInstance`, not one-to-one
        - `allPreparations` is now package private
        - `allDone` is now private
        - `startTasks` - Begins the reload of the listener.
        - `prepareTasks` - Runs the executor and sets up the futures needed to read and load all desired data.
        - `StateFactory$SIMPLE` - A factory that calls `PreparableReloadListener#reload`

### Block Effect Appliers

Effects that are applied to entities when inside a block are now handled through the `InsideBlockEffectApplier` and `InsideBlockEffectType`. The `InsideBlockEffectType` is an enum that contains a consumer on what to apply to an entity when called. `InsideBlockEffectApplier`, on the other hand, is stored on the entity has a way to apply an effect in a ordered manner based on the enum ordinals.

To call one of the effect types, you must override `BlockBehaviour#entityInside` or `Fluid#entityInside` and call `InsideBlockEffectApplier#apply`. If something should apply before the effect type, like entinguishing fire before freezing in powder snow, then `InsideBlockEffectApplier#runBefore` should be called before `apply`. Similarly, if something should run afterward, like hurting an enemy after being placed in lava, then `runAfter` should be called.

```java
// In some block or fluid subclass
@Override
protected void entityInside(Level level, BlockPos pos, Entity entity, InsideBlockEffectApplier applier) {
    applier.runBefore(InsideBlockEffectType.EXTINGUISH, entity -> {
        // Modify entity here.
    });

    // Do the base application logic stored on the type
    applier.apply(InsideBlockEffectType.FIRE_IGNITE);

    applier.runAfter(InsideBlockEffectType.FIRE_IGNITE, entity -> {
        // Perform any final checks that are as a result of the effect being applied
        entity.hurt(...);
    });
}
```

- `net.minecraft.world.entity`
    - `InsideBlockEffectApplier` - An interface that defines how an entity should interact when within a given block.
    - `InsideBlockEffectType` - An enum that defines what behavior to perform when side the specific block that references the type.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockBehaviour#entityInside`, `$BlockStateBase#entityInside` now takes in an `InsideBlockEffectApplier`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.material.Fluid#entityInside`, `FluidState#entityInside` - A method called whenever the entity is considered inside the bounding box of the fluid.

### Timer Callbacks, joining the codec club!

`TimerCallback`s, used in the server schedule for executing events, typically mcfunctions in datapacks, have now been reworked into a codec form. This means that a callback can be registered to the list of available callbacks by passing in the `MapCodec` to `TimerCallbacks#register` (via `TimerCallbacks#SERVER_CALLBACKS`) instead of the serializer.

- `net.minecraft.world.level.timers`
    - `FunctionCallback` is now a record
    - `FunctionTagCallback` is now a record
    - `TimerCallback`
        - `codec` - Returns the codec used for serialization.
        - `$Serializer` class is removed
    - `TimerCallbacks`
        - `serialize`, `deserialize` -> `codec`, not one-to-one

### The JOML Backing Interfaces

Mojang has opted to lessen the restriction on JOML objects by passing around the implementing interface of their logic objects (usually implemented with a tacked on `c`). For example, `Vector3f` becomes `Vector3fc` or `Matrix4f` becomes `Matrix4fc`. This does not change any logic itself as the `c` interfaces are implemented by the class components.

    - `eggs`
    - `flowers`

### Mob Effects Field Renames

Some mob effects have been renamed to their in-game name, rather than some internal descriptor.

- `MOVEMENT_SPEED` -> `SPEED`
- `MOVEMENT_SLOWDOWN` -> `SLOWNESS`
- `DIG_SPEED` -> `HASTE`
- `DIG_SLOWDOWN` -> `MINING_FATIGUE`
- `DAMAGE_BOOST` -> `STRENGTH`
- `HEAL` -> `INSTANT_HEALTH`
- `HARM` -> `INSTANT_DAMAGE`
- `JUMP` -> `JUMP_BOOST`
- `CONFUSION` -> `NAUSEA`
- `DAMAGE_RESISTANCE` -> `RESISTANCE`

### Very Technical Changes

This is a list of technical changes that could cause highly specific errors depending on your specific setup.

- The order of the `minecraft:patch_sugar_cane` feature and `minecraft:patch_pumpkin` feature have swapped orders (first pumpkin, then sugar cane), meaning modded biomes that generate both of these features will need to update their JSONs to the new ordering.

- Serveral vanilla oak tree and tree selector features now have `_leaf_litter` appended at the end.
    - For example: `trees_birch_and_oak` -> `trees_birch_and_oak_leaf_litter`
