# Primers

The primers in this repository are meant to provide a high level, non-exhaustive overview on migrating a mod between two Minecraft versions. Each section represents the version the primer is written for.

Primers for versions 1.12-1.17 have their vanilla and Forge changes combined into one. All other primers store vanilla changes in the main section, while mod loader changes are in a subsection with its name.

The primers were written by:
* [@williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus) for 1.12-1.15
* [@50ap5ud5](https://github.com/50ap5ud5) for 1.16-1.17
* [@ChampionAsh5357](https://github.com/ChampionAsh5357) for all other versions
