# Primers

The primers in this repository are meant to provide a high level, non-exhaustive overview on migrating a mod between two Minecraft versions. Each subdirectory represents the version the primer is written for.

Primers for versions 1.12-1.17 have their vanilla and Forge changes combined into one file. All other primers store vanilla changes in the main `index` file and mod loader changes in a file with its name.

The primers were written by:
* [@ChampionAsh5357](https://github.com/ChampionAsh5357)
* [@williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus) for 1.12-1.15
