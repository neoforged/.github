## Pack Changes

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=26.1&tab=changelog).

## Java 25 and Deobfuscation

26.1 introduces two new changes into the general pipeline.

First, the Java Development Kit has been upgraded from 21 to 25. Vanilla makes use of these new features, such as [JEP 447](https://openjdk.org/jeps/447), which allows statements before `super` within constructors. For users within the modding scene, please make sure to update accordingly, or take advantage of your IDE or build tool features. Microsoft's OpenJDK can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-25).

You may need to update your IDE to support Java 25. If using Eclipse, you will need at least either 2025-12, or 2025-09 with the Java 25 Support marketplace plugin. If using IntelliJ IDEA, you will need at least 2025.2.

Vanilla has also returned to being deobfuscated, meaning that all value types now have the official names provided by Mojang. There are still some things that are not captured due to the Java compilation process, such as inlining primitive and string constants, but the majority are now provided. This will only have a change for users or mod loaders who used a different value type mapping set from the official mappings.

## Loot Type Unrolling

Loot pool entries, item functions, item conditions, nbt providers, number providers, score providers, int providers, and float providers no longer use a wrapping object type to act as the registered instance. Now, the registries directly take in the `MapCodec` used for the serialization and deserialization process. As such, the `*Type` classes or records that held the codec have been removed. Additionally, `getType` is now renamed to `codec`, taking in the registered `MapCodec`.

```java
// The following is an example with LootItemFunctions, but can roughly apply to the other instances as well

public record NoopItemFunction() implements LootItemFunction {
    public static final NoopItemFunction INSTANCE = new NoopItemFunction();
    // The map codec used as the registry object
    public static final MapCodec<NoopItemFunction> MAP_CODEC = MapCodec.unit(INSTANCE);

    // Replaces getType
    @Override
    public MapCodec<NoopItemFunction> codec() {
        // Return the registry object
        return MAP_CODEC;
    }
}

// Register the map codec to the appropriate registry
Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.LOOT_FUNCTION_TYPE, Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "noop"), NoopItemFunction.MAP_CODEC);

## Validation Overhaul

The validation handler used to collect and then report problems with data-generated content has been overhauled. This is not, and has never been a replacement for field validation. The validation handler is specifically for more easily handling validation between multiple pieces of information that may not be exposed to a single field, such as whether a loot provider can be used for the given context params.

All validated objects implement either `Validatable`, or `CriterionTriggerInstance` specifically for advancement criteria. Both of these methods provide one method: `validate`, which is used to check the validity of an object. `validate` takes in a `ValidationContext`, which essentially holds the `ProblemReporter` used to collect issues, the current context params, and a reference resolver. `CriterionTriggerInstance` provides a `ValidationContextSource`, but this can be transformed to a `ValidationContext` using one of the `context` methods, providing the context params to check against. If the specific object cannot be validated, then `ValidationContext#reportProblem` is called, detailing the specific issue.

```java
// For some object that implements Validatable

@Override
public void validate(ValidationContext ctx) {
    // Check if a specific condition is validated.
    if (this.foo() != this.bar()) {
        // If not, report that there is an issue.
        ctx.reportProblem(() -> "'Foo' does not equal 'bar'.");
    }
}
```

If the object itself does not have any issues, but rather the specific fields, then the reporter can follow the stack trace while checking the individual elements using one of the `ValidationContext#for*` methods, performing something similar.

```java
// For some object that implements Validatable
// Let's assume it has a list of children objects.

@Override
public void validate(ValidationContext ctx) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.children.size(); i++) {
        // Get specific context for child in list
        var childCtx = ctx.forIndexedField("children", i);
        // Check if a specific condition is validated.
        if (this.foo() != this.bar()) {
            // If not, report that there is an issue.
            childCtx.reportProblem(() -> "'Foo' does not equal 'bar'.");
        }
    }
}
```

`Validatable` also provides some static utilities for checking other `Validatable` fields.

```java
// For some object that implements Validatable
// Assume some child object also implements Validatable

@Override
public void validate(ValidationContext ctx) {
    Validatable.validate(ctx, "child", this.child);
}
```

After `Validatable` is implemented on all required objects, the validation can then be called depending on where it is used (typically after deserialization or before serialization). The call stack for these is typically the following:

```java
// For some Validatable validatable
// Let's assume we have access to the HolderGetter.Provider provider.
// The parameter itself is optional if not available.

// Create the problem collector and validation context.
// The context params should only include the ones that are being provided.
ProblemReporter reporter = new ProblemCollector.Collector();
ValidationContext ctx = new ValidationContext(reporter, LootContextParamSets.ALL_PARAMS, provider);

// Call the validator
validatable.validate(ctx);
```

This can also be appended to the end of codecs via `Codec#validate`:

```java
public record ExampleObject() implements Validatable {
    public static final Codec<ExampleObject> CODEC = MapCodec.unitCodec(
        ExampleObject::new
    ).validate(
        // Supply the validator along with the context params to check against.
        // This method does not have access to the registry provider.
        Validatable.validatorForContext(LootContextParamSets.ALL_PARAMS)
    );

    @Override
    public void validate(ValidationContext ctx) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

    - `SetStewEffectFunction$EffectEntry` now implements `LootContextUser`

## Datapack Villager Trades

Villager trades has now become a data-generated registry from its original map-based setup. While basic impressions make it seem like that system is more limited, it is actually just as extensible, though in a rather convoluted way because the trades are functionally a loot table itself to determine what `MerchantOffer`s a trader can provide. For the purposes of understanding, this section will go over the basics of the trade rewrite, along with how each previous item listing can be converted to a `VillagerTrade`.

### Understanding the Trade Format

All trades are expressed as `VillagerTrade`s, which at its core determines what a trader `wants` and what it `gives` in return. Each trade can also provide modifiers to the item itself or its cost, or whether the specific trade can be made at all with the given condition. Each trade also specifies the number of trades that can be made, how much xp to give, or the price multiple that is multiplied with the user's reputation. A `VillagerTrade` is then turned into a `MerchantOffer` via `getOffer`, taking in the `LootContext`, typically with a context param of `LootContextParamSets#VILLAGER_TRADE`, providing the trader itself (`THIS_ENTITY`) and its position (`ORIGIN`).

The trades themselves are within `data/<namespace>/villager_trade/<path>`. Typically the path contains the profession and level the trade is for, such as `examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade`

```json5
// For some villager trade 'examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade'
// JSON at 'data/examplemod/villager_trade/example_profession/1/example_trade.json'
{
    // The stack the trader wants.
    "wants": {
        // The item of the stack.
        "id": "minecraft:apple",
        // A number provider used to determine how much
        // of the item that it wants. Once the count is
        // determined, any additional cost on the `gives`
        // stack (via `ADDITIONAL_TRADE_COST` component)
        // is added to the count before being clamped to
        // the max stack size.
        // If not specified, defaults to 1.
        "count": {
            "type": "minecraft:uniform",
            "min": 1,
            "max": 5
        },
        // Any components that stack should have. The stack
        // must have the exact components specified.
        // If not specified, then no components will be
        // checked, meaning that this is ignored.
        "components": {
            // Map of registry key to component value.
            "minecraft:custom_name": "Apple...?"
        }

        "id": "minecraft:emerald"
    },
    // The stack template the trader gives in return.
    "gives": {
        // The item of the stack.
        "id": "minecraft:golden_apple",
        // A number [1, 99].
        // If not specified, defaults to 1.
        "count": 1,
        // The components to apply to the stack.
        // If not specified, just applies the default
        // item components.
        "components": {
            "minecraft:custom_name": "Not an Apple"
        }
    },
    // A number provider to determine how many times
    // the trade can be performed by the player before
    // the trader restocks. The value will always be at
    // least 1. 
    // If not specified, defaults to 4.
    "max_uses": {
        "type": "minecraft:uniform",
        "min": 1,
        "max": 20
    },
    // A number provider to determine the price multiplier
    // to apply to the cost of the item based on the player's
    // reputation with the trader and the item demand,
    // calculated from how many times the player has performed
    // the trade. This should generally be a small number as
    // the maximum reputation a user can have per trader is 150,
    // though it's more likely to have a reputation of 25 at most.
    // However, the trade must always have a minimum of one item,
    // even if the reputation discount multiplied with the reputation
    // indicates 100% or more off.
    // If not specified, defaults to 0.
    "reputation_discount": {
        "type": "minecraft:uniform",
        "min": 0,
        "max": 0.05
    },
    // A number provider to determine the amount of experience
    // the player obtains from performing the trade with the trader.
    // This is typically around 5-30 xp for vanilla trades.
    // If not specified, defaults to 1.
    "xp": {
        "type": "minecraft:uniform",
        "min": 10,
        "max": 20
    },
    // A loot item condition that determines whether the
    // trader can provide the trade to the player.
    // If not specified, defaults to always true.
    "merchant_predicate": {
        // This trade can only be performed by villagers
        // from a desert or snow village.
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",

                    "minecraft:snow"
                ]
            }
        }
    },
    // A list of loot item functions that modify the item
    // offered from `gives` to the player.

    // or an enchantment tag, such as "#minecraft:trades/desert_common".
    // When provided, if the `gives` item after modifiers contains an
    // enchantment in this list, then the number of `wants` items required
    // is multiplied by 2.
    // If not specified, does nothing.
    "double_trade_price_enchantments": "#minecraft:trades/desert_common"
}
```

### The Trades of a Trader

Every trader can make many trades, typically choosing from a specified pool known as a `TradeSet`. Trade sets themselves are a separate datapack registry that consumes `VillagerTrade`s. Each set of trades determines how many trades can be offered and if the same trade can be chosen more than once. The trades that are offered are computed within `AbstractVillager#addOffersFromTradeSet`, first calling `TradeSet#calculateNumberOfTrades` to get the number of offers, and then using either `AbstractVillager#addOffersFromItemListings` or `AbstractVillager#addOffersFromItemListingsWithoutDuplicates` to choose the offers to use.

Note that if duplicate trades are allowed, there is a potential race condition where if all trades' `merchant_predicate`s fail, then the offers will loop forever. This is because the method always assumes that there will be one trade that can be made.

The trade sets are within `data/<namespace>/trade_set/<path>`. Typically the path contains the profession and level the trade is for, such as `examplemod:example_profession/level_1.json`

```json5
// For some trade set 'examplemod:example_profession/level_1'
// JSON at 'data/examplemod/villager_trade/trade_set/level_1.json'
{
    // Can either be a villager trade id, such as "examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade",
    // or a list of trade ids, such as ["examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade", "minecraft:farmer/1/wheat_emerald", ...],
    // or an trade tag, such as "#examplemod:example_profession/level_1".
    // This is the set of trades that can be offered by the trader.
    // This should always be a villager trade tag so allow other users
    // to easily add their own trades to a trader.
    "trades": "#examplemod:example_profession/level_1",
    // A number provider that determines the number of offers that can be
    // made by the trader.
    "amount": {
        "type": "minecraft:uniform",
        "min": 1,
        "max": 5
    },
    // Whether the same trade can be used to make multiple offers.
    // If not specified, defaults to false.
    "allow_duplicates": true,
    // An identifier that determines the unique random instance to
    // user when determining the offers.
    // If not specified, uses the level random.
    "random_sequence": "examplemod:example_profession/level_1"
}
```

Where the villager trade tag could be:

```json5
// For some tag 'examplemod:example_profession/level_1'
// JSON at 'data/examplemod/tags/villager_trade/example_profession/level_1.json'
{
    "values": [
        "examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade"
    ]
}
```

This also means trades can be easily added to existing trade sets by adding to the associated tag:

```json5
// For some tag 'minecraft:farmer/level_1'
// JSON at 'data/minecraft/tags/villager_trade/farmer/level_1.json'
{
    "values": [
        "examplemod:example_profession/1/example_trade"
    ]
}
```

Meanwhile, adding to a new `VillagerProfession` is done by mapping the level int to the trade set key in `tradeSetsByLevel`:

```java
public static final VillagerProfession EXAMPLE = Registry.register(
    BuiltInRegistries.VILLAGER_PROFESSION,
    Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_profession"),
    new VillagerProfession(
        Component.literal(""),
        p -> true,
        p -> true,
        ImmutableSet.of(),
        ImmutableSet.of(),
        null,
        // A map of profession level to trade set keys
        Int2ObjectMap.ofEntries(
            Int2ObjectMap.entry(
                // The profession level
                1,
                // The trade set id
                ResourceKey.create(Registries.TRADE_SET, Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example_profession/level_1"))
            )
        )
    )
);
```

### Item Listing Conversions

With all this in mind, we can now convert item listings to their new data-generated villager trades.

#### Emeralds <-> Items

For the following trades:

```java
public static final VillagerTrades.ItemListing ITEM_TO_EMERALD = new VillagerTrades.EmeraldForItems(
    // The item the trader wants.
    Items.WHEAT,
    // The number of items the trader wants.
    20,
    // The maximum number of times the trade can be made
    // before restock.
    16,
    // The amount of experience given for the trade.
    2,
    // The number of emeralds given in return.
    1

#### Villager Variants

Some traders would provide different options depending on the villager type it was as one giant map of item listings. Now, each type has its own individual villager trade, using a `merchant_predicate` to check whether the offer can be made to the specific villager type:

```json5
// For some villager trade 'examplemod:villager_type_item'
// JSON at 'data/examplemod/villager_trade/villager_type_item.json'
{
    // ...
    "merchant_predicate": {
        // Check the entity.
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "predicates": {
                // Villager type must be desert for this trade to be chosen.
                "minecraft:villager/variant": "minecraft:desert"
            }
        }
    },
    // ...
}

## `Level#random` field now protected

The `Level#random` field is now `protected` instead of `public`. As such, uses should transition to using the public `getRandom` method.

```java
// For some Level level
RandomSource random = level.getRandom();
```

- `net.minecraft.world.level.Level#random` field is now `protected` instead of `public`
    - Use `getRandom` method instead

## Data Component Initializers

Data components have begun their transition from being moved off the raw object and onto the `Holder` itself. This is to properly handle objects that are not available during construction, such as datapack registry objects for items. Currently, this is only implemented for `Item`s, but the system allows for any registry object, given its wrapped-holder, to store some defined data components.

Data components are attached to their holders through the `DataComponentInitializers`. During object construction, `DataComponentInitializers#add` is called, providing the `ResourceKey` identifier of the registry object, along with a `DataComponentInitializers$Initializer`. The initializer takes in three parameters: the builder for the component map, the full registries `HolderLookup$Provider`, and the key passed to `DataComponentInitializers#add`. The initializer functions like a consumer, also allowing for additional initializers to be chained via `$Initializer#andThen` or to easily add a component via `$Initializer#add`.

```java
// For some custom registry object
public ExampleObject(ResourceKey<ExampleObject> id) {
    // Register the data component initializer
    BuiltInRegistries.DATA_COMPONENT_INITIALIZERS.add(
        // The identifier for the registry object
        id,
        // The initializer function, taking in a component builder,
        // the registries context, and the id
        (components, context, key) -> components
            .set(DataComponents.MAX_DAMAGE, 1)
            .set(DataComponents.DAMAGE_TYPE, context.getOrThrow(DamageTypes.SPEAR))
    );
}
```

From there, the data components are initialized or reinitialized whenever `ReloadableServerResources#loadResources` is called (on datapack reload). The datapack objects are loaded first, then the components are set on the `Holder$Reference`s. From there, the components can be gathered via `Holder#components`.

```java
// For some Holder<ExampleObject> EXAMPLE_HOLDER
DataComponentMap components = EXAMPLE_HOLDER.components();
```

### Items

Since components are now initialized during resource reload, `Item$Properties` provides two methods to properly delay component initialization until such data components are loaded: `delayedComponent` and `delayedHolderComponent`. `delayedComponent` takes in the component type and a function that takes in the `HolderLookup$Provider` and returns the component value. `delayedHolderCOmponent` delegates to `delayedComponent`, taking in a `ResourceKey` and setting the registry object as the component value.

```java
public static final Item EXAMPLE_ITEM = new Item(
    new Item.Properties()
        .delayedComponent(
            // The component type whose construction
            // should be lazily initialized.
            DataComponents.JUKEBOX_PLAYABLE,
            // A function that takes in the registries
            // and returns the component value.
            context -> new JukeboxPlayable(context.getOrThrow(
                JukeboxSongs.THIRTEEN
            ))
        )
        .delayedHolderComponent(
            // The component type which has a
            // holder value type.
            DataComponents.DAMAGE_TYPE
            // The resource key for a registry
            // object of the associated holder
            // generic type.
            DamageTypes.SPEAR
        )
        // ...
);
```

Since data components now hold the true values from being lazily initialized after resource reload, `Recipe#assemble` no longer takes in the `HolderLookup$Provider`. Instead, it assumes that the recipe has all the required data stored passed into the recipe, either on a stack or directly.

    - `RegistryValidator` - An interface that validates the entries in a registry, storing all errors in a map.
    - `ResourceManagerRegistryLoadTask` - A load task that handles registering registry objects and tags from the local resource manager.
- `net.minecraft.server.ReloadableServerResources#updateStaticRegistryTags` -> `updateComponentsAndStaticRegistryTags`, not one-to-one
- `net.minecraft.world.item`
    - `EitherHolder` class is removed

- `net.minecraft.world.timeline.Timeline#validateRegistry` - Validates that each time marker was only defined once.

## Item Instances and Stack Templates

`ItemStack`s now have an immutable instance known as an `ItemStackTemplate`. Similar to the `ItemStack`, it contains the holder-wrapped `Item`, the number of items it represents, and a `DataComponentPatch` of the components to apply to the stack. The template can be transformed to a stack via `create`, or `apply` if adding additional data components. An `ItemStack` can likewise be turned into a template via `ItemStackTemplate#fromNonEmptyStack`. Templates are now used in place of `ItemStack`s were immutability is required (e.g., advancements, recipes, etc.). They provide a regular `CODEC`, a `MAP_CODEC`, and a `STREAM_CODEC` for network communication.

```java
ItemStackTemplate apple = new ItemStackTemplate(
    // The item of the stack
    Items.APPLE.builtInRegistryHolder(),
    // The number of items held
    5,
    // The components applied to the stack
    DataComponentPatch.builder()
        .set(DataComponents.ITEM_NAME, Component.literal("Apple?"))
        .build()
);

// Turn the template into a stack
ItemStack stack = apple.create();

// Creating a template from a non-empty stack
ItemStackTemplate fromStack = ItemStackTemplate.fromNonEmptyStack(stack);
```

To help standardize accessing the general components between the two, both the template and the stack implement `ItemInstance`, which provides access to the standard holder method checks, the count, and the `DataComponentGetter`. The common interface also means that if it doesn't matter whether the stack is mutable or not, then the `ItemInstance` can be used as the type.

```java
// Both are item instances
ItemInstance stack = new ItemStack(Items.APPLE);
ItemInstance template = new ItemStackTemplate(Items.APPLE);

// Get the holder or check something
Holder<Item> item = stack.typeHolder();
template.is(Items.APPLE);

// Get the number of items in the stack or template
int stackCount = stack.count();
int templateCount = template.count();

// Get the component values
Identifier stackModel = stack.get(DataComponents.ITEM_MODEL);
Identifier templateModel = template.get(DataComponents.ITEM_MODEL);
```

### Recipe Builders

Due to the addition of `ItemStackTemplate`s, `RecipeBuilder`s have changed slightly in their implementation. First, the builder no longer stores an `Item` for the result, instead defining the `defaultId` as the resource key recipe. As such, this allows for a more clear method of defining custom recipes that do not export an `Item`.

Of course, the change to this new format just has `defaultId` return `RecipeBuilder#getDefaultRecipeId` with the `ItemInstance` (either a stack or template), like so:

```java
public class ExampleRecipeBuilder implements RecipeBuilder {

    // The result of the recipe
    private final ItemStackTemplate result;

    public ExampleRecipeBuilder(ItemStackTemplate result) {
        this.result = result;
    }

    @Override
    public ResourceKey<Recipe<?>> defaultId() {
        // Get the default recipe id from the result
        return RecipeBuilder.getDefaultRecipeId(this.result);
    }

    // Implement everything else below
    // ...
}

## Serializer Records and Recipe Info

Recipes have been slightly reworked in their implementation. First, `RecipeSerializer` is now a record taking in the `MapCodec` and `StreamCodec` used to serialize and deserialize the recipe. As such, `Serializer` classes have been removed in their entirety, replaced with providing the codecs to the record during registration:

```java
// Assume some ExampleRecipe implements Recipe
// We'll say there's also only one INSTANCE
public static final RecipeSerializer<ExampleRecipe> EXAMPLE_RECIPE = new RecipeSerializer<>(
    // The map codec for reading the recipe to/from disk.
    MapCodec.unit(INSTANCE),
    // The stream codec for reading the recipe to/from the network.
    StreamCodec.unit(INSTANCE)
);
```

Second, some common data regarding the recipe settings and book information have been sectioned into separate objects. These objects are passed into the recipe as part of the constructor and used to more cleanly handle similar implementations across all recipes.

Vanilla provides four of these common object classes, split into two separate categories. `Recipe$CommonInfo` is used for general recipe settings. Meanwhile, `Recipe$BookInfo` is used for recipe book information, with `CraftingRecipe$CraftingBookInfo` for crafting recipes, and `AbstractCookingRecipe$CookingBookInfo` for cooking recipes (e.g., smelting, blasting, etc.). The common object classes provide methods for constructing the codecs as required, which can then be passed into the relevant recipe codec.

These classes are typically passed through the `Recipe` subclasses, used as boilerplate to implement abstract methods. None of the data in these objects are directly available outside the implementation itself, only through the methods defined in the `Recipe` interface. Because of this, classes like `NormalCraftingRecipe`, `CustomRecipe`, `SimpleSmithingRecipe`, and `SingleItemRecipe`, and `AbstractCookingRecipe` can be used to create a new recipe implementation by implementing a few methods.

Note that these common info classes are a design philosophy, which you can choose to implement if desired. It's only when building off existing recipe subtypes that you are required to make use of them.

    - `$WithAnyPotion` - A display with the contents having any potion contents component.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.storage.loot.functions.SmeltItemFunction#smelted` now can take in whether to use the input material count

## Dye Component

Specifying whether an item can be used as a dye material is now handled through the `DYE` data component. The component specifies a `DyeColor`, which can be set via `Item$Properties#component`:

```java
public static final Item EXAMPLE_DYE = new Item(new Item.Properties().component(
    DataComponents.DYE, DyeColor.WHITE
));
```

However, a dye material's behavior is not fully encompassed by the component alone. In most cases, the component is used in conjunction with some other tag or subclass to get the desired behavior.

### Entities and Signs

Dying sheeps and signs are handled purely through the `DyeItem` subclass, checking if the item has the `DYE` component. 

Dying the collars of wolfs and cats, on the other hand, can be any item, assuming it has the `DYE` component. Additionally, the item must be in the `ItemTags#WOLF_COLLAR_DYES` or `ItemTags#CAT_COLLAR_DYES` tag, respectively.

### Dye Recipes

The `DyeRecipe`, formerly named `ArmorDyeRecipe`, can take any target ingredient and apply the colors of the dye ingredients to obtain the desired result with the associated `DYED_COLOR` component. Any item can be considered a dye; however, those without the `DYE` component will default to `DyeColor#WHITE`. Armor makes used of `RecipeProvider#dyedItem` to allow any item in the `ItemTags#DYES` tag to dye armor. However, bundles and shulker boxes have their color components as different items, meaning instead the default recipes are tied directly to the vanilla `DyeItem`, meaning a separate recipe will need to be generated for applying dyes to those items.

The loom, firework star, and firework star face recipes on the other hand expect any dye material to have the `DYE` component. The loom has an additional requirement of the item being in the `ItemTags#LOOM_DYES` tag.

- `net.minecraft.core.component.DataComponents#DYE` - Represents that an item can act as a dye for the specific color.
- `net.minecraft.data.recipes.RecipeProvider`
    - `dyedItem` - Creates a dyed item recipe.

    - `DyeItem` no longer takes in the `DyeColor`
        - `getDyeColor`, `byColor` are removed
- `net.minecraft.world.item.component.DyedItemColor#applyDyes` now takes in a list of `DyeColor`s instead of `DyeItem`s
    - An overload can also take in a `DyedItemColor` component instead of the `ItemStack`
- `net.minecraft.world.item.crafting.ArmorDyeRecipe` -> `DyeRecipe`, not one-to-one
- `net.minecraft.world.item.crafting.display.SlotDisplay$DyedSlotDemo` - A display for demoing dying an item.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.block`
    - `BannerBlock#byColor` is removed
    - `ShulkerBoxBlock#getBlockByColor`, `getColoredItemStack` are removed

## World Clocks and Time Markers

World clocks are objects that represent some time that increases every tick from when the world first loads. These clocks are used as timers to properly handle timing-based events (e.g., the current day, sleeping). Vanilla provides two world clocks: one for `minecraft:overworld` and one for `minecraft:the_end`.

Creating a clock is rather simple: just an empty, datapack registry object in `world_clock`.

```json5
// For some world clock 'examplemod:EXAMPLE_CLOCK'
// JSON at 'data/examplemod/world_clock/EXAMPLE_CLOCK.json'
{}
```

From there, you can query the clock state through the `ClockManager` via `Level#clockManager` or `MinecraftServer#clockManager`:

```java
// For some Level level
// Assume we have some ResourceKey<WorldClock> EXAMPLE_CLOCK

// Get the clock reference
Holder.Reference<WorldClock> clock = level.registryAccess().getOrThrow(EXAMPLE_CLOCK);

// Query the clock time
long ticksPassed = level.clockManager().getTotalTicks(clock);
```

If accessing the clock from the server, you can also modify the state of the clock:

```java
// For some ServerLevel level
// Assume we have some ResourceKey<WorldClock> EXAMPLE_CLOCK

// Get the clock reference
Holder.Reference<WorldClock> clock = level.registryAccess().getOrThrow(EXAMPLE_CLOCK);

// Get the server clock manager
ServerClockManager clockManager = level.clockManager();

// Set the total number of ticks that have passed
clockManager.setTotalTicks(clock, 0L);

// Add the a certain value to the number of ticks
clockManager.addTicks(clock, 10L);

// Pause the clock
clockManager.setPaused(
    clock,
    // `true` to pause.
    // `false` to unpause.
    true
);
```

### Marking Timelines

On its own, world clocks are rather limited in scope as you have to keep track of the number of ticks that have passed. However, when used with timelines, specific recurring times can be marked to handle timing-based events.

As a refresher, `Timeline`s are a method of modifying attributes based on some `WorldClock`. Currently, all vanilla timelines use the `minecraft:overworld` world clock to keep track of their timing, via the `clock` field. All timelines must define a clock it uses; however, be aware that clocks to not support any synchronization by default, meaning that updating the time on one clock will not affect the other.

```json5
// For some timeline 'examplemod:example_timeline'
// In `data/examplemod/timeline/example_timeline.json
{
    // Uses the custom clock.
    // Any changes to the clock time will only affect
    // timelines using this clock.
    // e.g., `minecraft:overworld` will not be changed.
    "clock": "examplemod:example_clock",
    // Perform actions on a 24,000 tick interval.
    "period_ticks": "24000",
    // ...
}


// For some timeline 'examplemod:example_timeline_2'
// In `data/examplemod/timeline/example_timeline_2.json
{
    // Uses the same clock as the one above.
    // Changes to the clock time will affect both
    // timelines.
    "clock": "examplemod:example_clock",
    // Perform actions on a 1,000 tick interval.
    "period_ticks": "1000",
    // ...
}

// For some timeline 'examplemod:example_overworld'
// In `data/examplemod/timeline/example_overworld.json
{
    // Uses the vanilla overworld clock.
    // Changes to the clock time will not affect
    // the above timelines as they use a different
    // clock.
    "clock": "minecraft:overworld",
    // Perform actions on a 6,000 tick interval.
    "period_ticks": "6000",
    // ...
}
```

Timelines can also define time markers, which is just some identifier for a time within the timeline period for a world clock. These are commonly used within commands (e.g. `/time set`), to check if a certain time has passed (e.g. village sieges), or to skip to the given time (e.g. waking up from sleep). Time markers are defined in `time_markers`, specifying the `ticks` within the period and whether it can be `show_in_commands`. As time markers are identified by their world clock, timelines using the same world clock cannot define the same time markers.

```json5
// For some timeline 'examplemod:example_timeline'
// In `data/examplemod/timeline/example_timeline.json
{
    // The identifier of the clock.
    "clock": "examplemod:example_clock",
    // Perform actions on a 24,000 tick interval.
    "period_ticks": "24000",
    // The markers within the period specified by the timeline
    "time_markers": {
        // A marker
        "examplemod:example_marker": {
            // The number of ticks within the period
            // that this marker represents.
            // e.g., 5000, 29000, 53000, etc.
            "ticks": 5000,
            // When true, allows the time marker to be
            // suggested in the command. If false,
            // the time marker can still be used in the
            // command, it just won't be suggested.
            "show_in_commands": true
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Once the time markers are defined, they are registered for a world clock in the `ServerClockManager`, allowing them to be used given the `ResourceKey`.

```java
// For some ServerLevel level
// Assume we have some ResourceKey<WorldClock> EXAMPLE_CLOCK
// Assume we have some ResourceKey<ClockTimerMarker> EXAMPLE_MARKER

// Get the clock reference
Holder.Reference<WorldClock> clock = level.registryAccess().getOrThrow(EXAMPLE_CLOCK);

// Get the server clock manager
ServerClockManager clockManager = level.clockManager();

// Check if the time is at the specified marker
// This should be used when checking for a specific time event every tick
boolean atMarker = clockManager.isAtTimeMarker(clock, EXAMPLE_MARKER);

// Skip to the time specified by the marker
// If the world clock is at 3000, sets the clock time to 5000
// If the world clock is at 6000, sets the clock time to 29000
// Returns whether the time was set, which is always true if the marker
// exists for the clock.
boolean timeSet = clockManager.skipToTimeMarker(clock, EXAMPLE_MARKER);

## Splitting the Primary Level Data into Saved Data

Some of the `WorldData` settings have been moved into `SavedData`, allowing for levels / dimensions to have more customizability. This addition also brings along some changes to how `SavedData` is referenced and queried.

### Saved Data Changes

`SavedDataType` now identifies some `SavedData` using an `Identifier`, which is resolved against the data folder. This change allows subdirectories within the data folder, as the data storage will first create all missing parent directories before attempting to write the file.

```java
public class ExampleData extends SavedData {

    public static final SavedDataType<ExampleData> TYPE = new SavedDataType<>(
        // The identifier for the saved data to resolve against
        // Data can be found in:
        // `<world_folder>/dimensions/<dimension_namespace>/<dimension_path>/data/examplemod/example/data.dat`
        Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example/data"),
        // The constructor to create a new saved data
        ExampleData::new,
        // The codec to serialize the new saved data
        MapCodec.unitCodec(ExampleData::new),
        // The data fixer type
        // Either some patched enum value or null depending on mod loader implementation.
        null
    );
}
```

The `SavedData` can then be queried through the `SavedDataStorage`, renamed from `DimensionDataStorage`. This was renamed because the `MinecraftServer` instance now has its own data storage for global instances in addition to the levels. This means that any global saved data should be stored on the server instance rather than the overworld.

```java
// Given a MinecraftServer server
ExampleData data = server.getDataStorage().computeIfAbsent(ExampleData.TYPE);


// Given a ServerLevel level
ExampleData data = level.getDataStorage().computeIfAbsent(ExampleData.TYPE);
```

### Additional Saved Data

The following information is now stored as saved data:

- Custom boss events
- Ender dragon fight
- Game rules
- Wandering trader spawning
- Weather
- World generation settings

Of these, only the ender dragon fight is on a per-level / dimension basis. The rest are still stored and accessed through the server data storage. Custom boss events, on the other hand, remain unique as it is up to the implementer to determine what players are part of the event.

## Even More Rendering Changes

### Materials and Dynamic Layer Selection

Block and item models now no longer specify what `RenderType` or `ChunkSectionLayer` they belong to. Instead, this is computed when loading the model, determing the associated layer for each quad. This means that `ItemBlockRenderTypes` is removed, with setting the `RenderType` for an item removed altogether.

To determine what layer a quad or face gets set to, the `Transparency` of the texture is computed. Specifically, it checks that, for the UV area mapped to the quad, if there are any pixels that are transparent (have an alpha of 0), or translucent (have an alpha that is not 0 or 255). For the `ChunkSectionLayer`, `ChunkSectionLayer#TRANSLUCENT` is used if there is a translucent pixel, else `CUTOUT` is used if there is a transparent pixel, else `SOLID`. For the item `RenderType`, `Sheets#translucentItemSheet` and `translucentBlockItemSheet` for block items are used if there is a translucent pixel, or `cutoutItemSheet` and `cutoutBlockItemSheet` for block items. The `Transparency` also affects using `MipmapStrategy#AUTO`, using `CUTOUT` instead of `MEAN` as the default if there is a transparent pixel.

One can influence a quad's `Transparency` through the `Material` texture defined by the model JSON. A `Material` specifies the texture's `sprite`, which represents the relative path to the texture, and optionally `force_translucent`, which forces any quad using this texture to use `Transparency#TRANSLUCENT` (transparent is false while translucent is true):

```json5
// For some model `examplemod:example_model`
// In: `assets/examplemod/models/example_model.json`
{
    "parent": "minecraft:block/template_glass_pane_post",
    "textures": {
        // A Material can be a simple texture reference
        // Points to `assets/minecraft/textures/block/glass_pane_top.png`
        "edge": "minecraft:block/glass_pane_top",
        // Or it can be an object
        "pane": {
            // The relative texture reference for faces using this key
            // Points to `assets/minecraft/textures/block/glass.png`
            "sprite": "minecraft:block/glass",
            // When true, sets all faces using this texture key to
            // always have a transparent pixel.
            "force_translucent": true
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

This change also defines the rendering order, where all solid quads are rendered first, followed by cutout quads, and finally translucent quads, sorted by distance from the camera.

### Materials and Sprites

As you may have noticed, `Material`s were originally used to define some texture in an atlas. The addition of materials in texture JSONs have changed the naming of these classes. `Material`s now explicitly refer to texture references within model JSONs. This means that all references to the raw texture location have been replaced with `Material`, if unbaked, and `Material$Baked`, if baked. Additionally, the `SpriteGetter` is now `MaterialBaker`.

As for the original `Material`, these are now known as sprites, where `Material` is renamed to `SpriteId`, and `MaterialSet` is renamed to `SpriteGetter`.

### Quad Particle Layers

The `SingleQuadParticle$Layer`s have been split into `OPAQUE_*` and `TRANSLUCENT_*` layers, depending on if the particle texture used by the atlas contains a translucent pixel. Note that 'opaque' in this instance means cutout, where pixels with an alpha of less than 0.1 are discarded. If not creating a new layer, `$Layer#bySprite` can be used to determine what layer the particle texture should use.

```java
public class ExampleParticle extends SingleQuadParticle {

    private final SingleQuadParticle.Layer layer;

    public SingleQuadParticle(ClientLevel level, double x, double y, double z, TextureAtlasSprite sprite) {
        super(level, x, y, z, sprite);
        this.layer = SingleQuadParticle.Layer.bySprite(sprite);
    }

    @Override
    protected SingleQuadParticle.Layer getLayer() {
        return this.layer;
    }
}
```

### Block Models

The pipeline for rendering individual block models outside of the general world context has been rewritten similarly to `ItemModel`s, where a 'block model' updates some render state, which then submits its elements for rendering. As such, most of the block model classes have been either rewritten or reorganized to a degree.

Due to the block model name being synonymous with the model JSONs in general, many classes were moved and rename to separate the model JSONs, from the block state JSONs, from the now block models. As such, geometry for models that originally had 'block' in the name were changed to 'cuboid': (e.g., `BlockModel` -> `CuboidModel`, `BlockModelWrapper` -> `CuboidItemModelWrapper`). Additionally, parts of the rendering process referring to the definitions within a block state JSON were changed from 'block' to 'block state' (e.g., `BlockModelPart` -> `BlockStateModelPart`, `BlockModelDefinition` -> `BlockStateModelDispatcher`). You can consider most of the 'block model' classes to be new, with those renamed replacing the `SpecialBlockModelRenderer` system.

The block model system starts from the `ModelManager` after all models and definitions are loaded and resolved, ready to be baked. Block models are loaded through `BuiltInBlockModels#crateBlockModels`, which links some `BlockState` to a `BlockModel$Unbaked`. Similarly to item models, the unbaked instance defines the properties of how the block model should be constructed. These are stored within `LoadedBlockModels`, to which they are then subsequently baked after all JSONs into `BlockModel`s via `bake`. This `BlockState` to `BlockModel` map is then stored within the `BlockModelSet`, ready to be queried through `get`, or more commonly through `BlockModelResolver#update`, which calls in the model set. Any models not defined lazily resolve to a wrapper around the `BlockStateModel`.

Vanilla provides six `BlockModel` implementations for common usage. There is `EmptyBlockModel`, which submit no elements, and as such renders nothing; and `BlockStateModelWrapper`, which wraps around and displays the associated `BlockStateModel`. Then, there are equivalents for changing the model based on some property switch (`SelectBlockModel`), a conditional `boolean` (`ConditionalBlockModel`), and composing multiple models together (`CompositeBlockModel`). Finally, there is the `SpecialBlockModelWrapper`, which submits its elements through the stored `SpecialModelRenderer`, the unified submitter between item and block models.

```java
// As the block model system is hardcoded through its in-code bootstrap,
// this example will assume there exists some method to get access to the
// `BuiltInBlockModels$Builder` builder.

// We will also assume we have some Block EXAMPLE_BLOCK_* to attach the models to.

// Regular block model
builder.put(
    // A factory that takes in the `BlockColors` and `BlockState` to return
    // a `BlockModel$Unbaked`.
    (colors, state) -> new BlockStateModelWrapper.Unbaked(
        // The state to get the `BlockStateModel` of.
        state,
        // The tint layers for the model.
        colors.getTintSources(state),
        // An optional transformation to apply to the `PoseStack` before
        // submitting the model.
        Optional.empty(new Transformation(new Matrix4f().translation(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f)))
    ),
    // The block to use this model for. Will loop through a construct one
    // per state.
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_1
);

// Block model switched on some property
builder.put(
    (colors, state) -> new SelectBlockModel.Unbaked(
        // An optional transformation to apply to the `PoseStack` before
        // submitting the model.
        Optional.empty(),
        // A record containing the property to switch on, along with the
        // values when a specific block model should be selected.
        new SelectBlockModel.UnbakedSwitch<>(
            // The `SelectBlockModelProperty` to switch on. The property
            // value is determined from the `BlockState` and its `BlockDisplayContext`.
            (state, displayContext) -> state.getRenderShape(),
            // The list of cases to determine what `BlockModel` to use.
            List.of(
                new SelectBlockModel.SwitchCase<>(
                    // The list of values this model applies to.
                    List.of(RenderShape.INVISIBLE),
                    // The model to use when this property is met.
                    new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked()
                )
            ),
            // An optional fallback if no switch case matches the state's
            // property.
            Optional.of(new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked())
        )
    ),
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_2
);

// Block model based on some conditional
builder.put(
    (colors, state) -> new ConditionalBlockModel.Unbaked(
        // An optional transformation to apply to the `PoseStack` before
        // submitting the model.
        Optional.empty(),
        // The `ConditionalBlockModelProperty` that determines the
        // `boolean` from the `BlockState`.
        BlockState::isSignalSource,
        // The model to display when the property returns `true`.
        new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked(),
        // The model to display when the property returns `false`.
        new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked()
    ),
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_3
);

// A composite block model
builder.put(
    (colors, state) -> new CompositeBlockModel.Unbaked(
        // The first model to display.
        new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked(),
        // The second model to display.
        new EmptyBlockModel.Unbaked(),
        // An optional transformation to apply to the `PoseStack` before
        // submitting the model.
        Optional.empty()
    ),
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_4
);

// Special block model
builder.put(
    (colors, state) -> new SpecialBlockModelWrapper.Unbaked(
        // The unbaked `SpecialModelRenderer` used to submit elements for the
        // model.
        new BellSpecialRenderer.Unbaked(),
        // An optional transformation to apply to the `PoseStack` before
        // submitting the model.
        Optional.empty()
    ),
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_5
);
```

During the feature submission process, block models are handled through the `BlockModelResolver` and `BlockModelRenderState`. This is similar to how other render states work. First, `BlockModelResolver#update` sets up the `BlockModelRenderState`. Setup is handled through either the basic path -- `BlockModelRenderState#setupModel`, add the model parts to the returned list, then `setupTints`, or through `setupSpecialModel` for the special renderers. Then, the render state submits its elements for rendering through `BlockModelRenderState#submit`. The render state also provides `submitOnlyOutline` which uses the outline render type, and `submitWithZOffset` which uses the sold entity forward Z-offset render type.

```java
// BlockEntity example
public class ExampleRenderState extends BlockEntityRenderState {
    // Hold the render state.
    public final BlockModelRenderState exampleBlock = new BlockModelRenderState();
}

public class ExampleRenderer implements BlockEntityRenderer<ExampleBlockEntity, ExampleRenderState> {

    // The display context for use in the block entity renderer.
    public static final BlockDisplayContext BLOCK_DISPLAY_CONTEXT = BlockDisplayContext.create();
    private final BlockModelResolver blockResolver;

    public ExampleRenderer(BlockEntityRendererProvider.Context ctx) {
        super(ctx);
        // Get the model resolver.
        this.blockResolver = ctx.blockModelResolver();
    }

    @Override
    public void extractRenderState(ExampleBlockEntity blockEntity, ExampleRenderState state, float partialTick, Vec3 cameraPosition, ModelFeatureRenderer.CrumblingOverlay breakProgress) {
        super.extractRenderState(blockEntity, state, partialTick, cameraPosition, breakProgress);

        // Update the model state.
        this.blockResolver.update(state.exampleBlock, Blocks.DIRT.defaultBlockState(), BLOCK_DISPLAY_CONTEXT);
    }

    @Override
    public void submit(ExampleRenderState state, PoseStack pose, SubmitNodeCollector collector, CameraRenderState camera) {
        super.submit(state, pose, collector, camera);

        // Submit the model state for rendering.
        state.exampleBlock.submit(
            // The current pose stack,
            pose,
            // The node collector.
            collector,
            // The light coordinates.
            state.lightCoords,
            // The overlay coordinates.
            OverlayTexture.NO_OVERLAY,
            // The outline color.
            0
        );


    }
}

// Entity example
public class ExampleRenderState extends EntityRenderState {
    // Hold the render state.
    public final BlockModelRenderState exampleBlock = new BlockModelRenderState();
}

public class ExampleRenderer extends EntityRenderer<ExampleEntity, ExampleRenderState> {

    // The display context for use in the entity renderer.
    public static final BlockDisplayContext BLOCK_DISPLAY_CONTEXT = BlockDisplayContext.create();
    private final BlockModelResolver blockResolver;

    public ExampleRenderer(EntityRendererProvider.Context ctx) {
        super(ctx);
        // Get the model resolver.
        this.blockResolver = ctx.getBlockModelResolver();
    }

    @Override
    public void extractRenderState(ExampleEntity entity, ExampleRenderState state, float partialTick) {
        super.extractRenderState(entity, state, partialTick);

        // Update the model state.
        this.blockResolver.update(state.exampleBlock, Blocks.DIRT.defaultBlockState(), BLOCK_DISPLAY_CONTEXT);
    }

    @Override
    public void submit(ExampleRenderState state, PoseStack pose, SubmitNodeCollector collector, CameraRenderState camera) {
        super.submit(state, pose, collector, camera);

        // Submit the model state for rendering.
        state.exampleBlock.submit(
            // The current pose stack.
            pose,
            // The node collector.
            collector,
            // The light coordinates.
            state.lightCoords,
            // The overlay coordinates.
            OverlayTexture.NO_OVERLAY,
            // The outline color.
            state.outlineColor
        );
    }
}
```

### Block Tint Sources

`BlockColor` has been completely replaced by `BlockTintSource`, which sets the ARGB tint of a particular index based on the desired context. There are three contexts a tint source can provide:

- `color` for the general context, used by `BlockModel`s
- `colorInWorld` for the world context, used by `ModelBlockRenderer#tesselateBlock`
- `colorAsTerrainParticle` for the particle context, used by the falling dust and terrain particle

In addition, `BlockTintSource` provides a `relevantProperties` if the `Property`s of a `BlockState` are used to determine what color to tint. This is used by the `LevelRenderer` to determine whether a change in state requires a model to be re-rendered.

`BlockTintSource`s are still registered to `BlockColors` via `register`, taking in a list of sources followed by the vararg of blocks. The `tintindex` specfied in the model JSON is used to index into the tint source list.

```java
// Assume access to BlockColors colors
colors.register(
    // The list of tints to apply to some block model.
    List.of(
        // "tintindex": 0
        (state) -> 0xFFFF0000,
        // "tintindex": 1
        new BlockTintSource() {

            @Override
            public int color(BlockState state) {
                return 0xFF00FF00;
            }

            @Override
            public int colorInWorld(BlockState state, BlockAndTintGetter level, BlockPos pos) {
                return 0xFF0000FF;
            }
        }
    ),
    // The blocks these tint sources will apply to.
    EXAMPLE_BLOCK_1
);
```

### Removing the Old Block and Item Renderers

Since `ItemModel`s and `BlockModel` are now fully handled through their own feature submission pipeline, `BlockRenderDispatcher` and `ItemRenderer` have been completely removed, replaced by the corresponding systems.

### Object Definition Transformations

`ItemModel`s and `BlockModel`s can now take in an optional `Transformation`, which transforms how the model should be displayed. As such, the `$Unbaked#bake` methods now take in the parent `Matrix4fc` transformation, to which the transformation is multiplied to via `Transformation#compose`. For item models, this is known as a local transform separate from the model JSON item transform. The local transforms are always applied after the item transform.

Note that adding support for transformations should always be done through `Transformation#compose` as the matrices passed around are mutable by nature. Assume any custom methods not performed through a vanilla interface should copy before performing any modifications.

### Quad Instance

The brightness / tint color, lightmap, and overlay coordinates have been consolidated into a single object: `QuadInstance`. The mutable class sets its values through its associated `set*` methods, and can pull the information for each quad vertex via the `get*` methods. Brightness and tinting are stored together as the color, rather them being two separate values.

`QuadInstance` does not replace all usecases, such as when adding a single vertex. It only updates methods for the `VertexConsumer`, splitting `putBulkData` into `putBlockBakedQuad` for quads in block models, and `putBakedQuad` for all other uses.

In addition, mmany methods used to upload `BakedQuad`s to a buffer now take in a `BlockQuadOutput`. This has the same parameters as `VertexConsumer#putBlockBakedQuad`, and was added due to the section renderer uploading to a newly allocated `BufferBuilder` for use with the uber buffer.

### Gui Extractor

GUI classes methods have gone through a massive renaming scheme, indicating that the submitted elements are 'extracted' into a general tree to be submitted and then rendered. As such, methods that began with `draw*` or `render*` are now prefixed with `extract*`, and potentially suffixed with `*RenderState` (e.g., `Renderable#render` -> `extractRenderState`, `AbstractContainerScreen#renderLabels` -> `extractLabels`, `AbstractWidget#renderWidget` -> `extractWidgetRenderState`). Some shorthands were also expanded, either by renamining or replacing the method with another (e.g., `AbstractContainerScreen#renderBg` replaced by `Screen#extractBackground`).

`GuiGraphics` was also renamed to `GuiGraphicsExtractor` in the same fashion. The methods follow similar patterns to the rest of the GUI changes (e.g. `hline` -> `horizontalLine`), except that `draw*`, `render*`, and `submit*` prefixes along with `*RenderState` suffixes are removed (e.g. `renderOutline` -> `outline`, `submitEntityRenderState` -> `entity`). The only rename is that `*String*` method names are replaced with `*Text*`.

### Fluid Models

Defining a fluid's textures and tint has now been moved out of the `FluidRenderer` (previously `LiquidBlockRenderer`) and into its own separate `FluidModel` record. Initially, given the small number of fluids, the unbaked variants (`FluidModel$Unbaked`) are stored as constants. Then, after `BlockModel` have been baked, the fluid models are baked via `FluidStateModelSet#bake`, linking a `Fluid` to its `FluidModel`. This map is then stored within the `FluidStateModelSet`, ready to be queried through `get`.

A `FluidModel$Unbaked` has four arguments: three `Material`s for the still, flowing, and optional overlay textures; and one for the `BlockTintSource`. The tint is obtained via `BlockTintSource#colorInWorld`. During the baking process, it will determine the `ChunkSectionLayer` based on the transparency of the provided materials.

```java
// As the fluid model system is hardcoded within its baking, this example
// will assume there exists some method to get modifiable access to the
// `Map<Fluid, FluidModel>` fluidModels returned by `FluidStateModelSet#bake`.

// We will also assume we have some Fluid EXAMPLE_FLUID* to attach the models to.

FluidModel.Unbaked exampleFluidModel = new FluidModel.Unbaked(
    // The texture for the still fluid.
    new Material(
        // The relative identifier for the texture.
        // Points to `assets/examplemod/textures/block/example_fluid_still.png`
        Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "block/example_fluid_still"),
        // When true, sets all faces using this texture key to
        // always have a transparent pixel.
        true
    ),
    // The texture for the flowing fluid.
    new Material(Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "block/example_fluid_flowing")),
    // If not null, the texture for the overlay when the side of the fluid is
    // occluded by a `HalfTransparentBlock` or `LeavesBlock`.
    null,
    // If not null, the tint source to apply to the fluid's texture when in
    // the world.
    null

### Name Tag Offsets

`EntityRenderer#submitNameTag` has been renamed to `submitNameDisplay`, now optionally taking in the y offset from the name tag attachment.

### Tint Getter

`BlockAndTintGetter` is now a client only interface attached to the `ClientLevel`. It previous uses were replaced with `BlockAndLightGetter` -- which `BlockAndTintGetter` now extends -- with the tint and lighting directions stripped.

### Pipeline Depth and Color

Depth and color methods defined in the `RenderPipeline` have been consolidated into two state objects.

The `DepthTestFunction`, write `boolean`, and the bias `float`s are now stored in `DepthStencilState`. `DepthTestFunction` has been replaced with a more generic `CompareOp`, which defines how to compare two numbers. Each function has an simple equivalent, with `NO_DEPTH_TEST` replaced by `CompareOp#ALWAYS_PASS`. The depth information can be added to the pipeline via `RenderPipeline$Builder#withDepthStencilState`.

The optional `BlendFunction` and color / alpha `boolean`s are now stored in `ColorTargetState`. The `boolean`s are consolidated into an `int` using the lower four bits as flags: `1` is red, `2` is green, `4` is blue, and `8` is alpha. The color `boolean` uses `7` for red, green, and blue; the alpha `boolean` uses `8`; while both combined use `15`. The `LopicOp` is removed entirely. The color information can be added to the pipeline via `RenderPipeline$Builder#withColorTargetState`.

```java
public static final RenderPipeline EXAMPLE_PIPELINE = RenderPipeline.builder()
    .withLocation(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "pipeline/example"))
    .withVertexShader(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("examplemod", "example"))

    // Sets the color target when writing the buffer data.
    .withColorTargetState(new ColorTargetState(
        // Specifies the functions to use when blending two colors with alphas together.
        // Made up of the `SourceFactor` and `DestFactor`.
        // First two are for RGB, the last two are for alphas.
        // If the optional is empty, then blending is disabled.
        Optional.of(BlendFunction.TRANSLUCENT),
        // The mask determining what colors to write to the buffer.
        // Represented as a four bit value
        // 0001 - Write the red channel..
        // 0010 - Write the green channel.
        // 0100 - Write the blue channel.
        // 1000 - Write the alpha channel.
        ColorTargetState.WRITE_RED | ColorTargetState.WRITE_GREEN | ColorTargetState.WRITE_BLUE | ColorTargetState.WRITE_ALPHA
    ))
    // Sets the depth stencil when writing the buffer data.
    .withDepthStencilState(new DepthStencilState(
        // Sets the depth test function to use when rendering objects at varying
        // distances from the camera.
        // Values:
        // - ALWAYS_PASS           (GL_ALWAYS)
        // - LESS_THAN             (GL_LESS)

        CompareOp.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
        // Whether to mask writing values to the depth buffer
        false,
        // The scale factor used to calculate the depth values for the polygon.
        0f,
        // The unit offset used to calculate the depth values for the polygon.
        0f
    ))
    .build()
;
```

### Blaze3d Backends

`CommandEncoder`, `GpuDevice`, and `RenderPassBackend` has been split into the `*Backend` interface, which functions similarly to the previous interface, and the wrapper class, which holds the backend and provides delegate calls, performing any validation necessary. The `*Backend` interfaces now explicitly perform the operation without checking whether the operation is valid.

### Solid and Translucent Features

Feature rendering has been further split into two passes: one for solid render types, and one for translucent render types. As such, most `render` methods now have a `renderSolid` and `renderTranslucent` method, respectively. Those which only render solid or translucent data only have one of the methods.

### Camera State

The `Camera` has been updated similarly to other render state implementations where the camera is extracted to the `CameraRenderState` during `GameRenderer#renderLevel`, and that is passed around with the data required to either submit and render elements.

Due to this change, `FogRenderer#setupFog` now returns the `FogData`, containing all the information needed to render the fog, instead of just its color, and storing that in `CameraRenderState#fogData`.

## Minor Migrations

The following is a list of useful or interesting additions, changes, and removals that do not deserve their own section in the primer.

### Plantable Tags

The blocks to determine whether a plantable can survive or be placed on has been moved to block and fluid tags. Each of these tags starts with `support_*` along with the block (e.g., `bamboo`, `cactus`) or group (e.g., `crops`, `dry_vegetation`). This is handled by the relevant block subclasses overriding either `Block#canSurvive`, or for vegetation `VegetationBlock#mayPlaceOn`.

- `net.minecraft.world.level.block`
    - `AttachedStemBlock` now takes in a `TagKey` for the blocks it can be placed on
    - `FarmBlock` -> `FarmlandBlock`
    - `FungusBlock` -> `NetherFungusBlock`, not one-to-one
    - `RootsBlock` -> `NetherRootsBlock`, not one-to-one
    - `WaterlilyBlock` -> `LilyPadBlock`, not one-to-one
    - `StemBlock` now takes in a `TagKey` for the blocks it can be placed on, and a `TagKey` for the blocks its fruit can be placed on

### Container Screen Changes

The usage of `AbstractContainerScreen`s has changed slightly, requiring some minor changes. First `imageWidth` and `imageHeight` are now final, settable as parameters within the constructor. If these two are not specified, they default to the original 176 x 166 background image.

```java
// Assume some AbstractContainerMenu subclass exists
public class ExampleContainerScreen extends AbstractContainerScreen<ExampleContainerMenu> {

    // Constructor
    public ExampleContainerScreen(ExampleContainerMenu menu, Inventory playerInventory, Component title) {
        // Specify image width and height as the last two parameters in the constructor
        super(menu, playerInventory, title, 256, 256);
    }
}
```

Additionally, the `AbstractContainerScreen#render` override now calls `renderTooltip` at the end of the call stack. This means that, in most cases, you should not override `render` in subtypes of the `AbstractContainerScreen`. Everything can be done in one of the other methods provided by the class.

- `net.minecraft.client.gui.screens.inventory.AbstractContainerScreen` now optionally takes in the background image width and height
    - `imageWidth`, `imageHeight` are now final
    - `DEFAULT_IMAGE_WIDTH`, `DEFAULT_IMAGE_HEIGHT` - The default width and height of the container background image.
    - `slotClicked` now takes is a `ContainerInput` instead of a `ClickType`
    - `render` override now calls `renderTooltip` by default
- `net.minecraft.world.inventory`
    - `AbstractContainerMenu#clicked` now takes in a `ContainerInput` instead of a `ClickType`
    - `ClickType` -> `ContainerInput`

### New Tag Providers

A new `TagsProvider` has been added that provides a utility for working with `Holder$Reference`s, known as `HolderTagProvider`. This is only used by the `PotionTagsProvider`.

Additionally, the `TagBuilder` now provides a method of setting the `replace` field on a tag, which removes all previous read entries during deserialization.

- `net.minecraft.data.tags`
    - `FeatureTagsProvider` - A tag provider for `ConfiguredFeature`s.
    - `HolderTagProvider` - A tag provider with a utility for appending tags by their reference holder.
    - `KeyTagProvider#tag` now has an overload of whether to replace the entries in the tag.
    - `PotionTagsProvider` - A provider for potion tags.
    - `TradeRebalanceTradeTagsProvider` - A provider for villager trade tags for the trade rebalance.
    - `VillagerTradesTagsProvider` - A provider for villager trade tags.
- `net.minecraft.tags`
    - `FeatureTags` - Tags for `ConfiguredFeature`s.
    - `TagBuilder#shouldReplace`, `setReplace` - Handles the `replace` field that removes all previously read entries during deserialization.

### Test Environment State Tracking

`TestEnvironmentDefinition`s can now keep track of the original state of the world when being created, such that it can be properly restored on run. This is done through a generic known as the 'SavedDataType'. On `setup`, each environment will return the generic data representing the original state of what was modified. Then, on `teardown`, the original state will be restored to the level for the next test case.

```java
// The generic should represent the original data stored on the level
public record RespawnEnvironment(LevelData.RespawnData respawn) implements TestEnvironmentDefinition<LevelData.RespawnData> {

    @Override
    public LevelData.RespawnData setup(ServerLevel level) {
        // Modify the level while logging the original state.
        var original = level.getRespawnData();
        level.setRespawnData(this.respawn);

        // Return the original state.
        return original;
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown(ServerLevel level, LevelData.RespawnData original) {
        // Reset the state of the level to the original values.
        level.setRespawnData(original);
    }
    
    @Override
    public MapCodec<RespawnEnvironment> codec() {
        // Return the registered MapCodec here.
        // ...
    }
}
```

- `net.minecraft.gametest.framework.TestEnvironmentDefinition` now has a generic representing the original state of the given modification performed by the test environment
    - `setup` now returns the generic representing the original state
    - `teardown` is no longer default, taking in the original state to restore
    - `activate`, `$Activation` - Handles an active test environment. 

### Typed Instance

`TypedInstance` is an interface that is attached to certain objects that represent an instance of some other 'type' object. For example, and `Entity` is a typed instance of `EntityType`, or a `BlockState` is a typed instance of `Block`. This interface is meant as a standard method to provide access to the type `Holder` and check whether the backing type, and therefore the instance, is equivalent to some identifier, tag, or raw object via `is`.

```java
// For some Entity entity, check the EntityType
entity.is(EntityType.PLAYER);

// For some ItemStack itemStack, check the Item
itemStack.is(ItemTags.BUTTONS);

// For some BlockEntity blockEntity, check the BlockEntityType
blockEntity.is(BlockEntityType.CHEST);

// For some BlockState blockState, check the Block
blockState.is(Blocks.DIRT);

// For some FluidState fluidState, check the Fluid
fluidState.is(FluidTags.WATER);
```

    - `getBlockHolder` -> `typeHolder`
    - `getTags` -> `tags`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.material.FluidState` now implements `TypedInstance<Fluid>`
    - `holder` -> `typeHolder`
    - `getTags` -> `tags`

### Entity Textures and Adult/Baby Models

Entity textures within `assets/minecraft/textures/entity/*` have now been sorted into subdirectories (e.g., `entity/panda` for panda textures, or `entity/pig` for pig textures). Most textures have been named with the entity type starting followed by an underscore along with its variant (e.g., `arrow_tipped` for tipped arrow, `pig_cold` for the cold pig variant, or `panda_brown` for the brown panda variant).

Additionally, some animal models have been split into separate classes for the baby and adult variants. These models either directly extend an abstract model implementation (e.g., `AbstractFelineModel`) or the original model class (e.g., `PigModel`).

- `net.minecraft.client.animation.definitions`

### The Removal of interactAt

`Entity#interactAt` has been removed, with all further invocation merged with `Entity#interact`. Originally, `Entity#interactAt` was called if the hit result was within the entity's interaction range. If `interactAt` did not consume the action (i.e., `InteractionResult#consumesAction` returns false), then `Entity#interact` is called. Now, `Entity#interact` is called if within the entity's interaction range, taking in the `Vec3` location of interaction.

```java
// In some Entity subclass

@Override
public InteractionResult interact(Player player, InteractionHand hand, Vec3 location) {
    // Handle the interaction
    super.interact(player, hand, location);
}
```

`interactAt` checks if result does not consume the interaction, and if not calls `interact`
Now, `interact` is called with the entity hit

- `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer.MultiPlayerGameMode`
    - `interact` now takes in the `EntityHitResult`
    - `interactAt` is removed
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity`
    - `interact` now takes in a `Vec3` for the location of the interaction
    - `interactAt` is removed
- `net.minecraft.world.entity.player.Player#interactOn` now takes in a `Vec3` for the location of the interaction

### ChunkPos, now a record

`ChunkPos` is now a record. The `BlockPos` constructor has been replaced by `ChunkPos#containing` while the packed `long` constructor has been replaced by `ChunkPose#unpack`.

- `net.minecraft.world.level.ChunkPos` is now a record
    - `ChunkPos(BlockPos)` -> `containing`
    - `ChunkPos(long)` -> `unpack`
    - `toLong`, `asLong` -> `pack`

### No More Tripwire Pipelines

The tripwire render pipeline has been completely removed. Now, tripwires make use of `cutout` with an `alpha_cutoff_bias` of 0.1 for the texture.

- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.RenderPipelines#TRIPWIRE_BLOCK`, `TRIPWIRE_TERRAIN` are removed
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.chunk`
    - `ChunkSectionLayer#TRIPWIRE` is removed
    - `ChunkSectionLayerGroup#TRIPWIRE` is removed
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.rendertype.RenderTypes#tripwireMovingBlock` is removed

### Activities and Brains

Activities, which define how a living entity behaves during a certain phase, now are stored and passed around through `ActivityData`. This contains the activity type, the behaviors to perform along with their priorities, the conditions on when this activity activates, and the memories to erase when the activity has stopped. `Brain#provider` now takes in an `$ActivitySupplier` to construct a list of `ActivityData` the entity performs. 

Brains have also changed slightly. First, the `Brain` itself is not directly serializable. Instead, the brain is `$Packed` into the record, holding a map of its current memories. To get the memory types used, they are typically extracted from those that the `Sensor#requires`. Additionally, `LivingEntity#brainProvider` no longer exists, instead opting to store the provider in a static constant on the entity itself. This means that brains are now completely constructed through the `makeBrain` method, taking in the previous `$Packed` data:

```java
// For some ExampleEntity extends LivingEntity
// Assume extends Mob subclass
private static final Brain.Provider<ExampleEntity> BRAIN_PROVIDER = Brain.provider(
    // The list of sensors the entity uses.
    ImmutableList.of(),
    // A function that takes in the entity and returns a list of activities.
    entity -> List.of(
        new ActivityData(
            // The activity type
            Activity.CORE,
            // A list of priority and behavior pairs
            ImmutableList.of(Pair.of(0, new MoveToTargetSink())),
            // A set of memory conditions for the activity to run
            // For example, this memory value must be present
            ImmutableSet.of(Pair.of(MemoryModuleType.ATTACK_TARGET, MemoryStatus.VALUE_PRESENT)),
            // The set of memories to erase when the activity has stopped
            ImmutableSet.of(MemoryModuleType.ATTACK_TARGET)
        )
    )
);

@Override
protected Brain.Provider<ExampleEntity> makeBrain(Brain.Packed packedBrain) {
    // Make the brain, populating any previous memories
    return BRAIN_PROVIDER.makeBrain(this, packedBrain);
}

### File Fixer Upper

The file fixer upper is a new system to help with upgrading game files between versions, in conjunction with the data fixer upper. Similar to how the data within files can be modified or 'upgraded' between Minecraft versions via data fixers, file fixers can modify anything within a world directory, from moving files and directories to deleting them outright. As such, file fixers are always applied before data fixers.

Unlike when upgrading when data fixers, file fixers change the structure of the world folder. Because of this, downgrading is rarely possible, as the file names and locations will have likely changed location.

File fixers are applied through a `FileFix`, which defines some operation(s) to perform on a file using `makeFixer`. This is done typically through the `addFileContentFix`, providing access to the desired files through the `FileAccess`, and then modifying the data like any other `Dynamic` instance. Operations are commonly defined as `FileFixOperation`s, which can move the file structure around.

The file fixes are then applied through the `FileFixerUpper`, which uses a copy-on-write file system to operate on the files. The fixer is constructed using the `$Builder`, using `addSchema` and `addFixer` to apply the fixers for the desired version. During the upgrade process, the files are created in a temporary folder, then moved to the world folder. The original world folder is moved to another folder before being deleted.

### More Entity Sound Variant Registries

Cats, chickens, cows, and pigs now have sound variants: a databack registry object that specifies the sounds an entity plays. This does not need to be directly tied to an actual entity variant, as it only defines the sounds an entity plays, typically during `Mob#finalizeSpawn`.

For cows:

```json5

// - `data/examplemod/cow_sound_variant/example_cow_sound.json`
{
    // The registry name of the sound event to play randomly on idle.

### Input Message Editor Support

Minecraft now has support for Input Message Editors (IME), which allow complex characters from languages like Chinese or Hindi to be inputted instead of the temporary preedit text. The preedit text is displayed as an overlay within the game, while any other IME features provided by the host OS. With this addition, support can be added within screens through `GuiEventListener#preeditUpdated`, or by using an existing vanilla widget which implements the method.

- `com.mojang.blaze3d.platform`
    - `InputConstants#setupKeyboardCallbacks` now takes in the `GLFWCharCallbackI` instead of `GLFWCharModsCallbackI` for the character typed callback, `GLFWPreeditCallbackI` to handle inputting complex characters via an input method editor, and `GLFWIMEStatusCallbackI` for notifying about the status of the editor
    - `MessageBox` - A utility for creating OS native messages boxes. 
    - `TextInputManager` - A manager for handling when text is inputted in the game window.
        - `setTextInputArea` - Sets the area where the predicted text cursor should appear.
        - `startTextInput`, `stopTextInput` - Handles toggling the input message editor.
- `net.minecraft.client`
    - `KeyboardHandler`
        - `resubmitLastPreeditEvent` - Repeats the last preedit event that was sent.
        - `submitPreeditEvent` - Tells the listener that the preedit text has been updated.
    - `Minecraft`
        - `textInputManager` - Returns the input manager.
        - `onTextInputFocusChange` - Changes the editor input status based on if the text input is focused.
- `net.minecraft.client.gui.GuiGraphics`
    - `setPreeditOverlay` - Sets the overlay drawing the preedit text.
    - `renderDeferredElements` now takes in the `int`s for the mouse position and the game time delta ticks `float`
- `net.minecraft.client.gui.components`
    - `IMEPreeditOverlay` - The overlay for displaying the preedit text for an input message editor.
    - `TextCursorUtils` - A utility for drawing the text cursor.

- `net.minecraft.client.input`
    - `CharacterEvent` no longer takes in the modifier `int` set
    - `PreeditEvent` - An event containing the preedit text along with the cursor location.

### Cauldron Interaction Dispatchers

Cauldron interactions have been reorganized somewhat, with all registration being moved to `CauldronInteractions` from `CauldronInteraction`. In addition, the backing `$InteractionMap` for a cauldron type has been replaced with a `$Dispatcher` that can register interactions for both tags and items. Tags are checked before items.

```java
CauldronInteractions.EMPTY.put(
    // The Item or TagKey to use
    ItemTags.WOOL,
    // The cauldron interaction to apply
    (state, level, pos, player, hand, itemInHand) -> InteractionResult.TRY_WITH_EMPTY_HAND
);
```

- `net.minecraft.core.cauldron`
    - `CauldronInteraction`
        - All fields regarding to registering interactions to a map have been moved to `CauldronInteractions`
            - `INTERACTIONS` -> `CauldronInteractions#ID_MAPPER`, now `private`
        - `DEFAULT` - The default interaction with a cauldron
        - `$InteractionMap` -> `$Dispatcher`, not one-to-one
    - `CauldronInteractions` - All vanilla cauldron interactions.

### Rule-Based Block State Providers

`RuleBasedStateProvider` now extends `BlockStateProvider`, allowing it to be used wherever a state provider is required. It's implementation hasn't changed, now only requiring `rule_based_state_provider` to be specified as the `type`. As such, all configurations that used `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider` have been broadened to allow any `BlockStateProvider`.

- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.feature.configurations`
    - `DiskConfiguration` now takes in a `BlockStateProvider` instead of a `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider`
    - `TreeConfiguration` now takes in a `BlockStateProvider` instead of a `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider`
        - `belowTrunkProvider` is now a `BlockStateProvider` instead of a `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider`
        - `$TreeConfigurationBuilder` now takes in a `BlockStateProvider` instead of a `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider`
- `net.minecraft.world.level.levelgen.feature.stateproviders`
    - `BlockStateProvider#getOptionalState` - Gets the state of the block, or otherwise `null`.
    - `BlockStateProviderType#RULE_BASED_STATE_PROVIDER` - The type for the rule based state provider.
    - `RuleBasedBlockStateProvider` -> `RuleBasedStateProvider`, now a class, implementing `BlockStateProvider`
        - The constructor can now take in a nullable fallback `BlockStateProvider`
        - `ifTrueThenProvide` - If the predicate is true, provide the given block.
        - `simple` -> `always`
        - `$Builder` - A builder for constructing the rules for the block to place.

### Fluid Logic Reorganization

Generic entity fluid movement has been moved into a separate `EntityFluidInteraction` class, where all tracked fluids are updated and then potentially pushed by the current at a layer time. 

- `net.minecraft.world.entity`
    - `Entity`
        - `updateInWaterStateAndDoFluidPushing` -> `updateFluidInteraction`, not one-to-one
        - `updateFluidHeightAndDoFluidPushing` -> `EntityFluidInteraction#update`
        - `getFluidInteractionBox` - Gets the bounding box of the entity during fluid interactions.
        - `modifyPassengerFluidInteractionBox` - Returns the modified bounding box of the entity when riding in some vehicle. 
    - `EntityFluidInteraction` - A handler for managing the fluid interactions and basic movement with an entity.
- `net.minecraft.world.level.chunk.LevelChunkSection#hasFluid` - Whether the chunk section has a fluid block.

### Removal of Random Patch Feature

The random patch feature has been completely removed in favor of using placements like most other features. To convert, the `ConfiguredFeature` defined as part of the configuration should be its own file. Then, the placements should specify the `CountPlacement`, followed by the `RandomOffsetPlacement` using a `TrapezoidInt`, and finished with a `BlockPredicateFilter`:

```json5

        },
        {

            "type": "minecraft:block_predicate_filter",
            "predicate": {
                "type": "minecraft:all_of",
                "predicates": [
                    {
                        "type": "minecraft:matching_block_tag",
                        "tag": "minecraft:air"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "minecraft:matching_blocks",
                        "blocks": "minecraft:grass_block",
                        "offset": [ 0, -1, 0 ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
