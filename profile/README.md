We are _NeoForged_, a team of developers and moderators working on **NeoForge**, a free, open-source, community-oriented modding API for [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

We work with a large and vibrant community of volunteers — from moderators of our community, to maintainers of our repositories, to community contributors — to make NeoForge the best modding platform of choice for creating Minecraft mods.
